If you've ever done any amount of trouble shooting over the phone, you know what a great invention the ability to share your screen - or have someone else share their screen with you. Screen sharing is built into [iChat](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=iChat/4.0/en/11883.html) (or iMessage beta), Google Chat ([in Google+ Hangouts at least](http://lifehacker.com/5842191/google%252B-hangouts-adds-screen-sharing-google-docs-collaboration-and-more) and [Skype](https://support.skype.com/en-us/faq/FA10022/How-do-I-share-my-screen-in-Skype-for-Mac-OS-X). ![Screenleap](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-09-at-9.13.38-AM-725x349.png "Screenleap") [Screenleap](http://www.screenleap.com/) is a web site/app that allows you to share your screen with anyone. Nothing to download and nothing to install other then a Java applet. Share it with one person or share it with a whole bunch of people if you're wanting to demo something to your staff or clients. And it's free. So enjoy it while it's around because it'll probably be gone and/or sold off to a bigger company which will start charging for it. _Via [appstorm.net](http://web.appstorm.net/reviews/communications/screenleap-effortless-screen-sharing/)_
