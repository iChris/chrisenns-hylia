I've got the links working along the top. Nothing really on them yet except for the five2nine: year two video. For the nerds out there I've basically created 4 seperate blogs (regular blog, music, movies, photos) and am just using a single [menu.php](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/menu.php) file to load the menu system so I don't have to go through and change all the individual index pages each time I want to update the main menu. The movie page basically takes the movies I've uploaded to my [mac.com](http://www.mac.com) page and presents them as if they're on my own site. That way the bandwidth is being used up by Apple's servers and yet still looks like a local file. Very nerdy and very cool.
