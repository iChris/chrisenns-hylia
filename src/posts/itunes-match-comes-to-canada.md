_Finally_ [1](#fn-19910:1). ![iTunes Match in Canada](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iTunes-Match-in-Canada-725x610.jpg "iTunes Match in Canada") Look for the iTunes Match icon on the left hand side of iTunes, assuming it's up to date with at least 10.5.2, and then opt in for $27.99 per year to have all the music in your library in the iCloud - whether you purchased it through the iTunes store or not. The other perk is that you get all your music upgraded to 256Kbps DRM-free, even if you downloaded it from some crappy Russian MP3 site years ago. _cough_ allofmp3 _cough_

1.  That's a sarcastic finally in case you can't tell. Sarcasm is every Canadian's middle name, but it's hard to tell online. [↩](#fnref-19910:1)
