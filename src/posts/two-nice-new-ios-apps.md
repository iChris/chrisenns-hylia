Two apps that will no doubt be on upcoming episodes of [Appsession](http://ssktn.com/shows/appsession/). The first is a new Twitter client from [Tapbots](http://tapbots.com/) called [Tweetbot](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-a-twitter-client%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) (_$1.99, affiliate link_) that is a lot of fun to use. I'm only using it on the [@ssktn](http://www.twitter.com/ssktn) account to toot about new episodes. Certainly good to have an alternative to the official Twitter client. ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1477-200x300.png "Tweetbot") The second is an SSH client (non-nerds can tune out at this point) called [Prompt](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fprompt%252Fid421507115%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) (_$4.99, affiliate link_) from [Panic](http://panic.com/). I haven't used this one yet, but knowing the level of craftsmanship they put into their other applications ([Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) is the only FTP client you need) I have no doubt Prompt is going to be the best SSH client on an iOS device. Great that they include both the iPhone/iPod touch and iPad version in the same app.
