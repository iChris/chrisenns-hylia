Interesting tip from [Mac OS X Hints](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20120226205001628)[1](#fn-20117:1) showing how you could use Messages as a clipboard between your Mac and your iOS devices.

*   Copy a link, photo or text and paste into iMessage on Mac, iPhone or iPad.
*   Send a message to yourself.

1.  Time for a name change I guess since Apple's dropping the 'Mac' from the name. [↩](#fnref-20117:1)
