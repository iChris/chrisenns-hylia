Apple has [posted the video from their event on Monday](http://www.apple.com/live/2015-mar-event/) in case you wanted to re-watch it. \[footnote\]You did watch it live right? Who doesn't have 90 minutes free on a Monday to watch tech news?\[/footnote\] If you're curious about my thoughts, you can [listen to Tim Smith and myself discuss it on yesterday's Goodstuff Specials episode](http://goodstuff.fm/specials/13). The tl;dl \[footnote\]Too long, didn't listen\[/footnote\] version is this:

*   Apple's growing presence in China is a big deal. AFAIK it's a pretty big country.
*   Cheaper Apple TV is good. Not as cheap in Canada due to another adjustment by Apple reflecting the US Dollar.
*   The new [Game of Thrones trailer](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/gameofthrones/) is awesome.
*   HBO Now sounds great but only available in the U.S. for now.
*   Health Kit and Research Kit are incredible. Possibly the most important part of the presentation in my opinion.
*   The new MacBook looks interesting if you're not a power user or tired of your iPad Air and wanting to go back to a laptop.
*   Apple Watch just doesn't interest me. I have no doubt it's going to sell really well and I'm sure eventually I'll want one - but I don't have a real world use that I can justify $350+ for an Apple Watch.
*   Plus I hate the feeling of something on my wrist and was very happy to get rid of my watch when I started carrying a cell phone.

Are you going to order an Apple Watch?
