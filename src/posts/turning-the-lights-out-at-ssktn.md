At least for the near future, SSKTN.com as a website will exist primarily to redirect old episodes of podcasts like [Show Me Your Mic](http://goodstuff.fm/smym) to their new [Goodstuff.fm](http://goodstuff.fm) home.

> I’d really like to thank all listeners, guests and fans of SSKTN who’ve supported me and the podcasting I do over the years. Without having you tuning in, downloading and listening each week it goes without saying that I would have given up on this little hobby a long time ago.

With all my podcasting efforts being poured into Goodstuff, it's fairly obvious that something had to give with SSKTN. I still like the domain name and want to use it for _something_ at some point in the future. But for now, it'll be a simple landing page and redirecting service.
