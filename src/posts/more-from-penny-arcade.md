From their [review of the new Prince of Persia](http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2004-12-03#2328) game: _Just as in the first one, I traverse the combat oriented areas so I can arrive at the next perfected, genre defining platform section. It is like getting a ordering a pizza and getting a free walrus. Even if the walrus were excellent, I mean truly exemplary, I'm really not in the market for it and it's not why I ordered the pizza._
