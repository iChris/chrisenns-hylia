 _[Direct link to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTenMfvxACc)_ If you're a fan of music, or if you have some sort of soul, or you love hearing an Irish lad talk about lost love, or you appreciate a lyric that has a bit more thought put into it then the average fluff on the radio these days... Or if you really liked the movie '[Once](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/)' or just the song 'Falling Slowly' from that movie's soundtrack... If any of those things are true, then I suggest you check out [Strict Joy (Deluxe Edition) - The Swell Season](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fstrict-joy-deluxe-edition%252Fid334528009%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) (iTunes link). Plus, the dude can **sing**. Sing in such a way that if I wasn't happily married with a child I'd seriously consider gay-marrying him.
