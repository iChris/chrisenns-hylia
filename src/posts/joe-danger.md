Quick - what game from a certain video game console from the 80's does this new game shown below remind you of?  _[Direct link to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEME6Z74h4c&feature=player_embedded)_ Sign me up. Hopefully it comes out for Xbox Live Arcade sometime this year. The game is Joe Danger from [Hello Games](http://www.hellogames.org/).
