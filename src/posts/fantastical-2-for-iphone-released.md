If I wasn't already fairly happy with Calvetica ([$2.99 in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/calvetica-calendar/id385862462?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki), recently updated for iOS 7 as well) I'd definitely be taking a look at Fantastical 2 for iPhone ([$2.99 in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/fantastical-2/id718043190?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)). I use Fantastical on the Mac([$14.99 in the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/fantastical/id435003921?mt=12)) and love it's use of natural language for entering events.
