It looks great. It works great. The new mini 1Password toolbar app is great. [Pick it up in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/1password/id443987910?mt=12) and start using better passwords today. Might as well [grab the iOS version while you're at it](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) and use [Dropbox](http://db.tt/czHe7sK) or iCloud syncing to keep everything hooked up and in sync.
