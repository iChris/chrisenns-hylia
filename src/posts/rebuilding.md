Just to update anyone wondering, the server my blog was hosted on crashed and lost everything I had put up in the last year or so. Don't feel sorry for me though, I should've been doing backups. It's the same thing as opening an email that says "Here's a sweet screensaver!" with an attachment titled "annakornikova.exe". So since I have to rebuild, I'm going to start from the ground up and redesign and incorporate a photo section now that we've got a digital camera. In the meantime, go [get a song sung for you](http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/src/sing/default.asp) and [play a game of smack the penguin](http://www.casper.ru/temp/pingu3/?namn=422).
