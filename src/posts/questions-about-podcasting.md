If you've got 2 minutes to spare, I'd appreciate your feedback on a [questionnaire related to podcasting I put together](http://j.mp/podcastq). If you know nothing about podcasting or you know a ton, either way I'd appreciate your feedback! ![Damien podcasting in diapers](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/2807752682_69e37aa8ea.jpg) There's a $10 Starbucks card to 1 random person who fills it out the form. (limit of one entry per person, not valid in Quebec... employees of this blog not eligible for prize blah blah blah).
