[The future of Reeder](http://reederapp.com/reader/):

> Reeder for Mac and iPad will be updated to 2.0 in the coming months. Version 2.0 will add all the features of the iPhone version, including all sharing and syncing services. Until then, Reeder for Mac and Reeder for iPad will be free, starting today.

Download [Reeder for iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Freeder-for-ipad%252Fid375661689%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [Reeder for Mac](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Freeder%252Fid439845554%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) for free to try them out if you haven't yet. I use [Reeder for the iPhone](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Freeder%252Fid325502379%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) a bit but really prefer to read my RSS feeds on the Mac. I'm sure if I had one I'd move to the iPad for reading RSS feeds.[](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fsilvio-rizzi%252Fid325502382%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)
