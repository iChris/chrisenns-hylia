I've had a lot of people come up to me lately and ask if I know of any good iMovie training or tutorials and besides just doing a YouTube search, I hadn't come across anything. Then today I saw that Izzy of Izzy Video put out a [free tutorial series on iMovie so now I can send people there.](http://www.izzyvideo.com/imovie-tutorial/) It includes:

*   more than 2 hours of video training.
*   This tutorial is totally free to watch on his site!
*   (Optional) You can purchase the sample media to use as you follow along with the course if you choose (This includes a downloadable version of the course video as well.)

I know from watching many of his Final Cut Express/Pro tutorial videos over the years that Izzy does a such a great job producing these training videos. He's certainly one of the main inspirations for [my own screencasts and tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/lemonproductionsca).
