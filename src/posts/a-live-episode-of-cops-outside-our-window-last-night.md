We got home late last night after a visit with the fam and as we were going to bed I noticed what seemed to be flashing lights outside our window. Here's the play by play from my twitter account last night: [![Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.32 AM](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-11-at-8.18.32-AM-300x143.png "Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.32 AM")](https://twitter.com/iChris/status/3906191387) [![Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.42 AM](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-11-at-8.18.42-AM-300x134.png "Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.42 AM")](https://twitter.com/iChris/status/3906271640) [![Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.47 AM](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-11-at-8.18.47-AM-300x131.png "Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.47 AM")](https://twitter.com/iChris/status/3906382169) [![Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.52 AM](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-11-at-8.18.52-AM-300x113.png "Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.52 AM")](https://twitter.com/iChris/status/3906429574) [![Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.56 AM](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-11-at-8.18.56-AM-300x132.png "Screen shot 2009-09-11 at 8.18.56 AM")](https://twitter.com/iChris/status/3906522575) Thanks iPod touch for not correcting my spelling on that one. I'm pretty sure I meant to say 'important' and not impotant. Or impotent. I was in **no way** implying that possible drug dealers who were arrested outside my house are impotent. Please don't hurt us.

(_Not depicted on Twitter_: Sue and I arguing over whether a early 80's model car would have a trunk release, as opposed to just being opened with keys, and then why the cops weren't just using a crow bar to pry the trunk open. Also not depicted, Damien waking up crying 20 minutes after everything was finished and we were almost asleep.)
