I noticed today that [Google bought out Picasa.](http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/picasa.html) Picasa Software makes the [best photo organizing program](http://www.picasa.com/picasa/) this side of [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/) and I seriously recommend it to anyone using a digital camera on a Windows machine. It will make managing your photos so much easier - and for any [bloggers](http://www.blogger.com) out there, apparently it integrates well with your blogs! It'll be the best $29US you've ever spent on your computer.
