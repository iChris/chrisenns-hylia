I've been using [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/) and have been fine with it's [free iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/feedly-your-google-reader/id396069556?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) but I do miss the design and functionality of Reeder and when I have $4.99 in my app budget jar again, I'll be [picking up a copy in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki). It works for both iPhone and iPad. If it's good enough for [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/09/the-new-reeder-for-ios/), it's good enough for me.[](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
