> In July I was approached by a friend, who's basically an IT genius, and he offered some help. He said that he could trace the hackers and trolls for me using perfectly legal technology, which would lead to their IP addresses. I said yes.

Interesting story of one man confronting an online troll and the surprise he found. A good read for parents as they navigate the digital world with their kids.
