Tony Romo is a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys and he recently [released this statement](http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4755730/full-transcript-of-tony-romos-statement) on how he's processing being seriously injured in the later stages of his career and having to watch his replacement lead the team he was supposed to lead this year. He ends with this which is a great reminder of how so many issues in life come down to how you handle it as opposed to trying to change someone else:

> I feel like we all have two battles or two enemies going on. One with the man across from you. The second is with the man inside of you. I think once you control the one inside of you, the one across from you really doesn't matter.
