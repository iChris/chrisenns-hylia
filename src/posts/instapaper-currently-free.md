I'm not sure if it's ever happened but [Instapaper is currently free in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki).

> Instapaper is the simplest way to save and store articles for reading: offline, on-the-go, anytime, anywhere, perfectly formatted.

On a [recent episode of The Intellectual Radio Program](http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/15/), Adam, Tim and I debated Instapaper vs [Pocket](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/pocket-formerly-read-it-later/id309601447?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) (which is always free). I still stand by Instapaper as my go to read it later app of choice, and especially now that it's on sale for the low price of free.[](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
