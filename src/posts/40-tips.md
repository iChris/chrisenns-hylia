40 Tips in 40 Minutes was the name of a talk given by [David Sparks](http://www.macsparky.com/), [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/) and [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/) at MacWorld | iWorld 2012. [40tips.com](http://40tips.com/) is the follow up website with all the tips they mentioned - currently some of the tips anyways. One that was new to me of the list there so far is the ability to [CMD-OPTION CLICK on a Dock icon](http://40tips.com/cmd-opt-click-dock-icon-to-focus-an-app/) to focus on just that app. Handy.
