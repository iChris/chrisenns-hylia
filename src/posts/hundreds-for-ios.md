Neat looking puzzle game called [Hundreds (On sale for $2.99 until Jan 10th, Universal app for iPhone4+ and iPad1+ including iPad Mini.)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fhundreds%252Fid493536432%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) from the makers of [Canabalt](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcanabalt%252Fid333180061%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and [Wurdle](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fwurdle%252Fid287712243%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), two of my favourite iOS games:

> To win: tap & grow floating bubbles until they add to 100. There's just one catch: They turn red when touched. And if a bubble collides when red, you're dead. Simple in concept, deep in design, Hundreds explores emergent puzzles that combine the minimal with the strategic by introducing a multitude of objects over the course of 100 unique puzzles. For ages 2 to 222.
