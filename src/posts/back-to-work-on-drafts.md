Speaking of Drafts, [on the most recent episode of Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w/113) Merlin covers a lot of ground on why you might want to check out Drafts for iOS ([Drafts for iPhone $2.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts%252Fid502385074%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), [Drafts for iPad $3.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts-for-ipad%252Fid542797283%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) Like I said [in my earlier post](https://chrisenns.com/2013/04/drafts-for-iphone/), I'm still finding my way with Drafts but a lot of what Merlin said helps me know I'm at least on the right track with attempting to use Drafts in my workflow on my iPhone.[](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fagile-tortoise%252Fid331942785%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)
