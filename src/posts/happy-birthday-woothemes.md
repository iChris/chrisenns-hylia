It's WooThemes 4th birthday and they're throwing themselves a party in the form of a big sale. ![WooThemes](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WooThemes-600x250.png "WooThemes") I use WooThemes for a lot of my client sites [over at my day job](http://lemonproductions.ca) and for a variety of personal projects. You can [read about some of my favourite themes on my Recommendations page](https://chrisenns.com/recommends/woothemes/). You can get 40% off their [themes](http://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=http://www.woothemes.com/themes/) and [WooCommerce Extensions](http://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=http://www.woothemes.com/extensions/woocommerce-extensions/) or huge discounts on their [Standard Membership](http://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=https://www.woothemes.com/payment/checkout.php?package_id=3) or [Developer Membership](http://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=https://www.woothemes.com/payment/checkout.php?package_id=4). The sale runs until midnight July 13th 2012 (PST). Full credit to WooThemes for including a low point, when their site got massively hacked back in April, in their [timeline of events on their birthday announcement page](http://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=http://www.woothemes.com/birthday/). Customer data, money and information was kept secure and they recovered the rest of their site and managed great support along the way.
