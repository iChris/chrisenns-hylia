HTML5 killed the MP3 star? Make sure you're using [Google's Chrome web browser](http://www.google.com/chrome) and then load up [http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/](http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/). They build an interactive video using an address you put in, pulling images and data from Google Maps/etc. Don't be alarmed by all the browser windows opening up and closing - that's just part of the "experience."
