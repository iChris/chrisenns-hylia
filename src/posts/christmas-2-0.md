The story of the nativity as told using social media: My prediction: this will be played at many churches in an attempt to illustrate how hip to the internet said churches are when if you send them a message to their Twitter account, you'll never get a reply and if you click the button linking to their Flickr account on their website, they never setup a Flickr account - the button is only there because it was included in the free template they are using for their website. Hypothetically speaking, of course. _Video via [@stolteclan](http://twitter.com/stolteclan/status/15458601137086466) / [Direct link to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZrf0PbAGSk)_
