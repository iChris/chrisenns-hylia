Matt Wiebe of Automattic joins me to talk all things WordPress - version 3.5 was just released as of the recording and Matt had a hand in part of the features. We talk CMS, WordPress.com vs WordPress.org and how Winnipeg is surviving without the Jets this year. (Ok, we didn't actually cover that last one.)
