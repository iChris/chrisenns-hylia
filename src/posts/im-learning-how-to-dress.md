The site (and corresponding [podcast](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=338552753)) is called [Put This On](http://putthison.com). It's teaching me how to dress myself. I'm just going to quote [this post](http://putthison.com/post/811624289/start-by-simplifying) in it's entirety:

> Do you want to know how to start looking better? Simplify. Stop wearing clothes with logos, prints and crazy details. Instead, focus on great basics. When I say basics, I mean basics. White t-shirt. Blue dress shirt. White oxford. Blue jeans. Gray wool pants. Khaki chinos. Blue blazer. Gray suit. Great boots. Basic shoes. Focus on blue, white, gray. Buy good clothes that fit. Minimalize. It’s OK for your clothes to be a simple frame for what’s important: **you**.
