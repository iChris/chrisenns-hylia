A bunch of apps are free this week to celebrate the 5th Anniversary of the App Store. Check out [the full list at Tools and Toys](http://toolsandtoys.net/great-free-apps-io/) but these are some of my recommendations to grab that I've used:

*   [Day One for iPhone and iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fday-one-journal-diary%252Fid421706526%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is a journaling app that is a great way to record thoughts, ideas, journals. I use it primarily as a photo journal by choosing a picture from my iPhone's camera roll and then adding a few thoughts about the moment, event or day the picture was from. Day One allows you to export a PDF, email or print and share your journals with friends. It's the one journal that I've kept at longer than any other.
*   [Tiny Wings for iPhone](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftiny-wings%252Fid417817520%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [Tiny Wings HD for iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftiny-wings-hd%252Fid541517597%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is a fun, colourful game that's easy to play and hard to master.

And here are a few that I haven't tried myself but look interesting:

*   [Over](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fover%252Fid535811906%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is an app that allows you to put text and artwork over your photos.
*   [BADLAND for iPhone and iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fbadland%252Fid535176909%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is a side scrolling game that looks great.
*   [Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsuperbrothers-sword-sworcery%252Fid424912055%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is a classic iOS game that I never got around to picking up. Done.
*   [How to Cook Everything for iPhone and iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fhow-to-cook-everything%252Fid409936319%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) looks like an app/book/thing that I could certainly use.

Which apps are you most excited about grabbing?
