Matt Drance on Facebook's invasion of Google's [Home Turf](http://www.appleoutsider.com/2013/04/05/home-turf/):

> I think we’ll know well before the end of this year how Facebook Home affects handset sales. If buyers start asking “does it have Facebook Home?” — and I think many will — that will be bad news for both Google and Apple. However, the Google – Facebook war is sure to be more vicious than the Google – Apple war because Google and Facebook have the same customers: advertisers. Users are their currency, and Facebook is about to rob the bank.

An interesting thought because Apple could stand to come out ok in all of this since they're not dependant on advertisers - Apple depends on users. Apple is happy to advertise on Google and Facebook because they need to sell real, physical things to users - not sell user's data to advertisers.
