Looks like Minecraft built in the Toca Boca world - in other words, great! ([$0.99 launch price special](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftoca-builders%252Fid652077009%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30))

> If you can imagine it you can build it with the six Toca builders! Join your new builder friends on an island far away and create a whole new world with blocks. Jump, walk, roll and rotate the builders to use their unique skills, and they will help to build whatever you can imagine!
