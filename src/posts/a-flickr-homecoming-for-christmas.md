Echoing some of the fun of easily browsing your Instagram stream while allowing you to upload high quality DSLR images to the web, Flickr's updated version of their iOS app ([free on the App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fflickr%252Fid328407587%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) shows that Yahoo isn't letting this property die on the vine. I'm willing to bet that Flickr will happily play nice with Twitter, unlike [Instagram who recently pulled support](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/) for showing of their photos in Twitter's cards. To which Twitter responded[1](#fn-21047:1) by [adding the ability to filter your photos](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/twitter-photos-put-filter-on-it.html), as if the filters were the thing people flocked to Instagram for. If Flickr can pull the community back from the various services they've left to ([500px](http://500px.com), Instagram, Facebook, Google+, etc.), then it could be a great homecoming of sorts for one of the first great photo communities on the web.
