If you look at [Apple.com](http://www.apple.com/) and compare it with [Apple.ca](http://www.apple.com/ca/), there's one key thing missing in the features listed for the iPhone 4S:

### Apple.ca

### Apple.com

![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iPhone4US.png "iPhone4US") Sadly, no [Siri](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html) for Canada. Yet. It's [coming](http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/10/04/siri-is-coming-to-canada/), just looks like Apple has to "Canadian-ize" it first. So, adding in a few "eh's", some bacon, and the ability to understand all the requests for "Siri, why didn't the Leafs make the playoffs again this year?"
