Apple released iOS 6.1 today - [see Macrumors for full details](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/01/28/apple-releases-ios-6-1-with-new-lte-carriers-and-fandango-siri-integration/) with a few minor looking updates unless you were waiting for LTE support:

*   LTE support for more carriers (complete list of supported carriers at [www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/](http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/)
*   Purchase movie tickets through Fandango with Siri (USA only)
*   iTunes Match subscribers can now download individual songs from iCloud
*   New button to reset the Advertising Identifier

Apple also released an update for the Apple TV - [hit up Macrumors for more](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/01/28/apple-updates-apple-tv-with-up-next-and-bluetooth-keyboard-new-appletv32-model-revealed/) with some great new features:

*   iTunes in the Cloud: Browse and play your purchased iTunes music directly from iCloud.
*   Bluetooth keyboard: Use your Apple Wireless Keyboard to control your Apple TV.
*   AirPlay audio for videos: Send stereo audio from movies, TV shows, and other videos on Apple TV to AirPlay-enabled speakers and devices (including AirPort Express and other Apple TVs).
*   Stability and performance: Includes performance and stability improvements with the iTunes Store, AirPlay, Netflix, iTunes Match, and wired Ethernet connections.

A Bluetooth keyboard option is great for anyone who has tried setting up an Apple TV and had to type in long WiFi/Apple account passwords. And the ability to send audio from a video you're watching to another AirPlay device is great for listening to a video while you're making a sandwich in the kitchen.
