Personally I think blacking out [websites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2), [tweets](https://twitter.com/ryanbaldwin/status/159671559450132480) and [photos](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2012/01/18/pipa-sopa/) isn't the best way to protest something that could do exactly that - better to go out and make and share content showing what is possible now and explain how that might go away. Which is what this video by [Kirby Ferguson](http://vimeo.com/kirbyferguson)[1](#fn-19991:1) does a great job of. Explain what's at stake [Direct link to video](http://vimeo.com/31100268) SOPA and PIPA are American issues now but if enacted would certainly affect us all a great deal. And there's a pretty good history of Canada attempting to simply follow along with the entertainment/government of the USA so it's a good idea to be informed about what's going on down south.
