PopClip is a Mac application that turns copy and paste on your Mac into the same pop-up style as on your iOS device. ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/searchshot.png "searchshot") It's available [from the Mac App Store for $4.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fpopclip%252Fid445189367%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or you can [download a free trial from their website](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) that has a neat method of expiring: you get 150 uses of the app before you have to buy it.

#### Set the size, whether you want it to open links or not, enable dictionary loop up or correct spelling:
