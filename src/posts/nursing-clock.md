It's worth checking out this app \[**update** - no longer available. check out [this as an alternative](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/nursing/id660294534?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)\], if only for the great icon by [David Lanham](http://dlanham.com/) of the [Icon Factory](http://iconfactory.com/home). But it's also worth grabbing if you need it for what it does:

*   Keeps track of which breast was last used (indicated by the white diamond)
*   Stopwatch displays the duration of the current feeding
*   Shows the start time of the previous feeding
*   Keeps the screen on so you can always glance at the time, hands-free
*   Easy to read from a distance
*   Keeps time even if you leave the app

It's [$0.99 in the App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fnursing-clock%252Fid525195468%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and is by Marco Arment, creator of the popular [Instapaper for iOS](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstapaper%252Fid288545208%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) who's wife recently had a baby. If you'd like to hear the full story of how it was created, you can listen to the first 20 minutes or so of [Build and Analyze episode 78](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/78) where Dan and Marco discuss the idea of creating an app that wasn't Instapaper to experience the other side of the App Store.
