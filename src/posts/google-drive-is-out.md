Google unveiled [their cloud storage option](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2012/04/introducing-google-drive-yes-really.html), called Google Drive. 5GB for free. Pay to upgrade to more storage. iOS apps coming soon. Nothing compelling enough to warrant switching from [Dropbox](http://db.tt/czHe7sK) in my opinion. The competition will be good but I'm not interested in giving even more of my digital life over to Google. They've already got too much as it is.
