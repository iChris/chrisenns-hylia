An interesting change of plans from a company that rarely bows to public pressure through a [letter from outgoing hardware chief Bob Mansfield](http://www.apple.com/environment/letter-to-customers/):

> Weâ€™ve recently heard from many loyal Apple customers who were disappointed to learn that we had removed our products from the EPEAT rating system. I recognize that this was a mistake. Starting today, all eligible Apple products are back on EPEAT.

Key words being eligible products. _Via [John Moltz's verynicewebsite.net](http://verynicewebsite.net/2012/07/a-letter-from-big-bob-mansfield/)_
