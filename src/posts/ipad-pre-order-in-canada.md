You can now pre-order an iPad through [Apple Canada](http://store.apple.com/ca/go/ipad/): ![iPad Pricing in Canada](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ipadpricingcanada1.png "iPad Pricing in Canada") Unless you plan on watching a lot of movies, you don't really need a large size. From our experience here at the office (my co-worker got one sent up from the states) it's not like an iPod/iPhone where you want a lot of your music with you. It's unlikely that you're going to go jogging with your iPad on an armband. The 16GB will be plenty for most people I'd imagine.
