For any World War 2/history buffs out there, [this flash animation/movie](http://english.pobediteli.ru/flash.html?DR=0) is a great visual of how World War 2 went down. ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-12-at-9.47.19-PM-300x195.png "WW2 Animation") You may have to wait a bit for the flash to load as it's quite a large file/site - but well worth it if that kind of thing interests you at all. Kind of makes me want to pull out that copy of [Axis and Allies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_&_Allies) that I have that's never actually been used.
