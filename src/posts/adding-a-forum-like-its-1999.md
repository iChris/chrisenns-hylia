Last night I had the thought that I should setup a forum and link the more popular posts on my blog to the forum for further discussion, questions or comments. Posts like the one on using [AirPlay with Apple TV](https://chrisenns.com/2011/11/airplay-with-apple-tv-and-airport-express/) and the [1Password Username / Safari Bookmark shortcut](https://chrisenns.com/2012/03/1password-username-password-in-safari-bookmarks/) end up getting a lot of traffic but people tend to just hit that page and leave. One side of my head says it's not really what people are after. The geeky side of my head likes to have an excuse to play with different software - in this case [Vanilla Forums](http://vanillaforums.org/). My heart loves the idea of building and fostering community. The middle ground is that it can come in handy if someone needs something similar for my [day job](http://lemonproductions.ca). So [go kick the tires on the new forum and leave a comment](https://chrisenns.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/3/kick-the-tires-on-the-new-forum#Item_1). Just like back in 1999.
