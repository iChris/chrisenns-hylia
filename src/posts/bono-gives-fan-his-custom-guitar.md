At the end of their recent Nashville show, Bono notices a fan - who happens to be blind - holding up a sign that says he would love to play a song for his wife. Bono brings him up on stage and starts singing 'All I Want is You' with him, eventually the whole band joins in.  
  
After the song, Bono sends him away with his custom built Gretsch tele. A [beautiful guitar](http://blog.forevercaptive.com/post/4250365248/tele-for-bono-and-other-custom-shop-pieces) and an amazing experience for this fan.
