Panic, maker of amazing software like Transmit and Coda, are also publishing a beautiful new game called Firewatch:

> In Firewatch, you play as a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. Your supervisor, a woman named Delilah, is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio — and is your only contact with the world you’ve left behind.

[Check out the first 17 minutes of gameplay on IGN](http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/03/02/firewatch-17-minutes-of-new-gameplay-ign-first) to get a taste for it - but it reminds me of playing Police Quest/King's Quest games from Sierra back in the day, only with modern graphics and mechanics. On [Panic's blog](http://www.panic.com/blog/firewatch-demo-day-at-gdc/) they show the incredible detail they went to in order to promote the game at the recent Game Developers Conference. Firewatch is slated to be released in late 2015 for Mac/PC.
