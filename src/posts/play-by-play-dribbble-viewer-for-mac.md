[Play by Play ($2.99)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fplay-by-play%252Fid474543724%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is a Mac app that functions as a viewer/browser for the popular design site [Dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com/). The attention to detail [on the icon alone](http://dribbble.com/shots/356510-Play-by-Play-icon) makes it worth buying. [![Play by Play Icon](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/pbp-large-725x543.png "Play by Play Icon")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/pbp-large.png) Look at your dock right now and see if any of your other icons have a moustache. If the answer is no, then you should probably buy this app. [![Play by Play - David Keegan](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-lrg.gif)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fplay-by-play%252Fid474543724%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)
