Version 10.0.3 has a lot of features added that video nerds have been asking for since Apple revamped their Final Cut Pro software, but the biggest feature to me is the multicam functionality.

Think about handling a multicam project that includes footage from DSLRs and DV, HDV, and professional cameras, without having to pre-process the content first. You can change, add, or delete camera angles at any time and work with different codecs, frame sizes, and frame rates without conversion.
