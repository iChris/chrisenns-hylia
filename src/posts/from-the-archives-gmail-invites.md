From back in 2004, entitled [More Gmail Action](https://chrisenns.com/2004/06/15/more-gmail-action/), when Gmail was an invite only site. Obviously I didn't have the good sense to try and sell my invites on ebay. Google still has the Invite a Friend box in Gmail: ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/inviteafriend.jpg "Invite a Friend to Gmail") Though I'm not sure why they put a limit on it when it's free to sign up for now.
