Avid recently updated a bunch of hardware and software ([see this post on Macrumors.com for full details](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/04/08/avid-announces-media-composer-7-and-pro-tools-11-ios-compatible-recording-hardware/)) but the one point I found interesting is that the new versions of their [Fast Track Solo](http://www.avid.com/US/products/fasttrack-solo) and [Fast Track Duo](http://www.avid.com/US/products/fasttrack-duo) include the ability to plug into iPad 2 or newer or iPad minis.

\[gallery columns="2" ids="21334,21335,21336,21337"\] I have an older Fast Track series audio device and they work great as portable recording studios for podcasting or music production. Paired with GarageBand for iOS ([$4.99 in the App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fgarageband%252Fid408709785%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) it's crazy how powerful a recording studio you could have in your backpack.
