Think [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) is just some useless toy for the kids who like sharing the fact that they're going to bathroom right now? The [US State Department asked Twitter not go offline for scheduled maintenance](http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSWBT01137420090616) so that people could continue to communicate in Iran during the election protests. I guess this could also be a new form of propaganda and control the US gov't is trying to exert, but at least they don't have control over the actual information being spread.
