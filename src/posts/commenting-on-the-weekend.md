It seems that people are having problems with the comments. I don't really know what's wrong as it seems to be working for me... but if you've made a comment and it didn't show up, send me an email and let me know. Hope everyone has a good weekend. It looks to be pretty nice out here with a possibility of some rain (which isn't a bad thing considering how dry it is).
