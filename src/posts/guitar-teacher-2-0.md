Anthony Stauffer, [guitar teach to the masses over at StevieSnacks.com](http://steviesnacks.com), has started a new blog called [Guitar Teacher 2.0](http://guitarteacher20.com) where he's planning to share his story of "running an accidentally successful business."

> In 2007 I started putting free guitar lessons on YouTube. In January 2008 I began selling longer videos. In 2009 I left my job to keep. Today StevieSnacks has been my fulltime job for over 3 years. This blog is the place where I write about the day-to-day work and decisions involved with running an accidentally successful business. My work at StevieSnacks is complicated, tedious and extremely nerdy. Sometimes when I have a nerd victory, I need to share it with someone.
