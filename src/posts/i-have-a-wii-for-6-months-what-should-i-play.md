I've been loaned a Nintendo Wii by my brother-in-law while they're gone for 6 months. The games they have are: [![Wii Games We Borrowed](http://www.minivanmegafun.ca/wp35/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Wii-Games-We-Borrowed-620x463.jpg)](http://www.minivanmegafun.ca/wp35/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Wii-Games-We-Borrowed.jpg):

*   Super Mario Brothers Wii
*   Lego Batman 2
*   Lego Pirates of the Caribbean
*   Batman The Brave and the Bold
*   Super Mario Galaxy
*   Skylanders (I seriously need this one explained to me!)
*   Donkey Kong Country Returns (Not pictured above)

_I'm listing these games to show that I already have them to play. I'm looking for **other** ideas of what to play._ We've never really played any Wii games. We have an Xbox 360 so we've played any games that are available on both platforms (i.e. Lego Star Wars, etc.) Up until the Wii I was a huge Nintendo fan and owned the original NES and played a bunch of games on the Super NES.

### This is Where You Come In

So my question to you, faithful and knowledge readers of my blog, what games should we play in our short window with a Wii?
