[Here's an interesting read](http://www.kevinsites.net/2004_11_21_archive.html#110107420331292115) from a freelance cameraman in Iraq. He's someone who actually sees what the soldiers are dealing with up close and personal. In this entry he describes a recent battle at a mosque where what seems to be already wounded people are shot and killed to make sure they're dead. It's something I disagree with sitting in my chair at home, but I can't even begin to imagine being a 19 yr old in a country where a lot of people are wanting your death. I'd be pretty trigger happy as well.
