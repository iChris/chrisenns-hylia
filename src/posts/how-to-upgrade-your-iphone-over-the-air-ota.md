**Note:** Check out an [updated version of this post with iOS 7 and beyond screenshots and instructions](https://chrisenns.com/2014/03/ios-7-1-update-out-how-to-update-your-ios-device/). Apple today released iOS 5.01 - a minor update to iOS 5 that includes:

*   Fixes bugs affecting battery life
*   Adds Multitasking Gestures for original iPad
*   Resolves bugs with Documents in the Cloud
*   Improves voice recognition for Australian users using dictation [1](#fn-19771:1)

As this is the first time for most people to be able to use over the air (OTA) updating instead of having to update via iTunes, I thought I'd post the steps to do the update. [2](#fn-19771:2) [3](#fn-19771:3)

### Find Settings.app

It has the gear style icon: [![Settings.app](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate01-200x300.jpg "Settings.app")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate01.jpg)

### General

Scroll down until you see the **General** section: [![General](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate02-200x300.jpg "General")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate02.jpg)

### Software Update

Assuming you've got 5.0 properly installed you should see a **Software Update** item: [![Software Update](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate03-200x300.jpg "Software Update")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate03.jpg)

### Checking for Update

The iPhone will ping Apple's servers to see if there's an update: [![Checking for Update](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate04-200x300.jpg "Checking for Update")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate04.jpg)

### iOS 5.01 Download and Install

You should see the **Download and Install** option beneath the description of what's in the update: [![Download and Install](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate05-200x300.jpg "Download and Install")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate05.jpg) _[Click here to see what's behind the Learn More option](/wpblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate06.jpg)_

### Terms & Conditions

Hooray! T&C. Make sure you run it past your lawyer before you agree to install. [![Terms & Conditions](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate07-200x300.jpg "Terms & Conditions")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate07.jpg)

### Connect Your iPhone To a Power Source

If you aren't already plugged into something, it prompts you to plug it in: [![Software Update Connect your iPhone to a power source while the download is in progress to save battery.](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate08-200x300.jpg "Software Update Connect your iPhone to a power source while the download is in progress to save battery.")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate08.jpg)

### Download Ahoy!

It took just under 2 minutes to download but your connection speed will vary: [![Less than 1 minute remaining](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate09-200x300.jpg "Less than 1 minute remaining")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate09.jpg)

### Preparing Update

It took longer to prepare the update than it did to download: [![Preparing Update](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate10-200x300.jpg "Preparing Update")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate10.jpg)

### iOS 5.01 Will Be Installed In 7 Seconds

Click install or watch it countdown: [![Software Update iOS 5.01 will be installed in 7 seconds. Your iPhone will restart when installation is finished.](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate11-200x300.jpg "Software Update iOS 5.01 will be installed in 7 seconds. Your iPhone will restart when installation is finished.")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate11.jpg)

### Verifying Update

Depending on how many other Apple nerds are doing it at the same time as you, this could take a few minutes: [![Verifying Update](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate12-200x300.jpg "Verifying Update")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate12.jpg)

### Restart and then Restart Again

At this point the visual tour ends as I can't take screenshots while it's restarting and installing. But my iPhone restarted a couple of times with a progress bar both times. After the second restart/progress bar, my iPhone rebooted to a normal screen and was done. A quick check back into **Software Update** reveals that iOS 5.0.1 is installed and I'm up to date. [![iOS 5.0.1 Your software is up to date](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate13-200x300.jpg "iOS 5.0.1 Your software is up to date")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/otaiosupdate13.jpg) Done.
