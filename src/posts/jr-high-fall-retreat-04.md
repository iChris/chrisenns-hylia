Whew. The retreat this weekend wiped me out - and I wasn't even an 'official' leader this time. There were some really cool kids that I got to meet this weekend.. with some crazy names. Kenia, Adan, Naamen. I'm just guessing on the spelling because I never actually saw them written down. I also did a good job of promoting (evangelising?) Apple on the retreat. I was just diddling around with [Garageband](http://www.apple.com/ca/ilife/garageband/) and then few kids started to wonder what I was doing. Pretty soon, half the kids were wanting a Apple so they could make their own music. heh heh. Sue will have the pictures up later - I'll link them once they're up.
