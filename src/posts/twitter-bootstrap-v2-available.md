[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/?v=2.0) is a great base or starting point for web developers with support for cross browsers (Internet Explorer 7 & up, tablets, smartphones), grid based for easier layout, and a responsive design that adapts to the various devices it's on ([view the page itself and resize your browser window to get an idea of what that looks like](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/?v=2.0)). ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Twitter-Bootstrap.png "Twitter Bootstrap") It's a great template to use for quick one pager sites that don't require a lot of content to be changed later (_i.e. [groveyouth.com/](http://www.groveyouth.com/) which isn't actually built with Bootstrap, but only because it wasn't out when I was building that landing page_) or for a really high traffic site where you don't want a heavy, slow CMS making people wait for it to render out the content.
