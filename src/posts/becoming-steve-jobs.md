I know what I'll be reading later this month:

> A brilliantly reported, compellingly written book that overturns the conventional view of Steve Jobs—the Jobs that is frozen forever as half genius, half jerk—Becoming Steve Jobs answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time?

John Gruber's [review of Becoming Steve Jobs](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/03/02/becoming-steve-jobs) could not contrast more with [his review of the Walter Isaacson biography](http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs): \[footnote\]Thanks to [Kari](https://twitter.com/kayayarai) and [Megan](https://twitter.com/mccheesen) for their help with this sentence.\[/footnote\]

> The book is smart, accurate, informative, insightful, and at times, utterly heartbreaking.

And

> The book is an accurate, engaging retelling of the known history of Jobs’s life and career, but also contains a significant amount of new reporting. There are stories in this book that are going to be sensational.

It's too bad the [promotional website](http://becomingstevejobs.com) looks like it was built in iWeb, but that's no reason to avoid the book.
