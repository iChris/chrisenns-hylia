I haven't done one of these in awhile [1](#fn-21715:1) but on the eve of the Mac Pro as we know it possibly disappearing, here's what the most expensive Mac (non-server) you can order from Apple is looking like [2](#fn-21715:2):

Mac Pro
-------

*   Two 3.06GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon (12 cores)
*   64GB (8x8GB)
*   512GB solid-state drive
*   512GB solid-state drive
*   512GB solid-state drive
*   2TB 7200-rpm Serial ATA 3Gb/s hard drive (**Might as well have one big drive for back up/storage**)
*   ATI Radeon HD 5870 1GB
*   One 18x SuperDrive
*   Apple LED Cinema Display (27" flat panel)
*   Apple LED Cinema Display (27" flat panel)
*   Magic Mouse
*   Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad

**Price before tax** - $12,917.00. Applecare for $279 would be a no-brainer if you're buying all that. Now how about the iMac?

iMac
----

*   3.5GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz
*   32GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM - 4X8GB
*   1TB Flash Storage
*   Apple USB SuperDrive
*   NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M 4GB GDDR5
*   Apple Magic Mouse
*   Apple Wireless Keyboard (English) & User's Guide

**Price before tax** - $4,088.00. We'll see how this looks by tomorrow afternoon after the Apple event. If the Mac Pro gets a final release date and new cinema (_cough_ retina _cough_) displays get released, I suspect the $12k price point could actually go higher and not lower for the latest, greatest Mac.

1.  The last time was [December, 2012](https://chrisenns.com/2012/12/new-imacs-available-for-order/) but I didn't price out the most expensive Mac possible. [↩](#fnref-21715:1)
2.  Canadian pricing obviously. It's the only currency that's worth talking aboot eh? [↩](#fnref-21715:2)
