Ticket to Ride is [now available for the Mac for $9.99 on the Mac App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fticket-to-ride%252Fid470834073%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
