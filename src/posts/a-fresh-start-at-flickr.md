From a post today on the [Flickr blog](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2012/01/13/start-the-new-year-fresh)

> This year is going to be big at Flickr! In the coming weeks and months you will see significant updates to Flickrâ€™s user experience, new features and offerings across devices. Our goal is to build a gorgeous, intuitive, and truly beautiful experience for you, your friends and your photos.

I really hope this is more than just good marketing speak. My annual Pro registration at Flickr is coming due and there's less and less reasons to keep using it. It's now more of a feature on other products that keep me there, like the fact that I can stream photos from my Flickr account on my AppleTV rather than having to have a computer running. We'll have to see if it truly is going to be a big year at Flickr or not. Flickr certainly hasn't done much innovative and creative since being bought out by Yahoo in 2005 and they've got to be ditched by a lot of people who use Facebook/Google+/etc for sharing photos these days.
