New to me in iTunes' preferences in iTunes 10.3: ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Playcount-in-iTunes-10.3new.png "Playcount in iTunes 10.3new") So if your iPhone, AppleTV or other shared computer(s) play a song, the play count goes up. Great for stats nerds like me who lost sleep over the fact that play counts weren't getting updated previously.
