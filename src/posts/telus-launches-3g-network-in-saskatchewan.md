Telus' website is [now offering the iPhone 4 for Saskatchewan](http://www.telusmobility.com/en/SK/home/): [![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/telusiphone4-300x167.png "Telus iPhone 4")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/telusiphone4.png) Called over to the local Best Buy and they still aren't able to sell them due to "an email received on the weekend." The guy I talked to indicated they did still have them. When I asked the best way to find out when they were going to be able to sell the iPhone 4, his response was to "just keep calling."
