You can [preorder your shiny new black cylinder from Apple.com](http://store.apple.com/ca/mac/family/mac-pro) - pricing starts at $3,099CDN+tax with no monitor, keyboard or mouse. But what's the fun in that? Let's price out the top end Mac Pro with a shiny new Sharp[1](#fn-21803:1) display. ![Mac Pro](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mac-Pro.jpg)

### Mac Pro Specs

*   2.7GHz 12-core with 30MB of L3 cache
*   64GB (4 x 16GB) of 1866MHz DDR3 ECC
*   1TB PCIe-based flash storage
*   Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each
*   Apple Magic Mouse

*   User's Guide (English)

All for $13,957.00 + tax. You can [check out the previous generation Mac Pro loaded up](https://chrisenns.com/2013/10/mac-pro-loaded-up-pre-apple-event/) (spoiler: it was $12,917.00+tax) and see they're offering more for less, depending on how you feel about having your hard drives internal or external. I won't be buying one anytime soon but I'll be curious to hear about real world usage for [Final Cut Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) - which also saw an update today to 10.1 - and [Logic Pro X](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/logic-pro-x/id634148309?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) users.
