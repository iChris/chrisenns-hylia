Or in other words, here's my first podcast that I'm involved with - in front of the mic as it were: [U2log.com audio podcast episode 001](http://u2log.lemonproductions.ca/2009/04/episode-001-inauguration-day/) I'm joined by [Christopher Schmitt](http://christopherschmitt.com/), a fellow contributer to [u2log.com](http://www.u2log.com) (_and [published author/web design guru](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0735712638?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclos0a-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=0735712638)_), and we discuss U2 related stuff. Listen to me "yeah" and "ugh" along with Christopher. It's not for everyone but I know that I had fun recording it as well as editing it together and figuring out the whole podcasting recording/setup/etc. I'll post my workflow somewhere if anyone is interested. (_[Wiretap Studio](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/) was a great thing to get as part of the [Macheist](http://www.macheist.com/) bundle_) As I mentioned, I hate the sound of my voice.
