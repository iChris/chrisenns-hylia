Since Apple decided to mess with the DigitalColor Meter application in Lion, I've been on the hunt for a new colour picker. [Gradient](http://www.gradientapp.com/) looks like it could be a good replacement. It gives you a nice menu bar based colour picker, as well as outputting all the CSS code you need to throw in a stylesheet for a nice looking gradient. It's in beta right now and you can sign up at the website for a preview download. ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-14-at-12.52.05-PM.png "Gradient.app") I'd still like the ability to grab a single colour code out and I can't seem to find a way to do that without getting the whole gradient CSS code. But Gradient.app makes a nice option for web work.
