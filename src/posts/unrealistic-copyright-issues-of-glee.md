Not that Sue has slowly pulled me into the show while I noodle around on my laptop when she's watching it:

> In one recent episode, the AV Club helps cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester film a near-exact copy of Madonna's Vogue music video (the real-life fine for copying Madonna's original? up to $150,000). Just a few episodes later, a video of Sue dancing to Olivia Newton-John's 1981 hit Physical is posted online (damages for recording the entirety of Physical on Sue's camcorder: up to $300,000). And let's not forget the glee club's many mash-ups -- songs created by mixing together two other musical pieces. Each mash-up is a "preparation of a derivative work" of the original two songs' compositions - an action for which there is no compulsory license available, meaning (in plain English) that if the Glee kids were a real group of teenagers, they could not feasibly ask for -- or hope to get -- the copyright permissions they would need to make their songs, and their actions, legal under copyright law. Punishment for making each mash-up? Up to another $150,000 -- times two.

The basic idea is that Fox, the TV network that shows Glee, is also part of the same media empire that would go around suing Girl Scout troops for singing copyrighted songs at camp. _Via [Boingboing](http://feeds.boingboing.net/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/a4egJXRgC_w/glee-vs-copyright-do.html)_
