The much anticipated app for Twitter nerds on their iPhones is [1](#fn-21744:1) out. [Tweetbot 3 for iPhone is $2.99 in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8) (currently on sale). Check out the [MacStories review](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all/) and [Shawn Blanc's video review](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/10/video-review-new-tweetbot-ios7/) of what looks to be a good update to an already great app. As is to be expected, there is no upgrade path for current Tweetbot for iPhone users - so [grab it while it's on sale](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8).
