I'm currently using the [Blackbird Pie Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-blackbird-pie/) which is the unofficial-offical WordPress version but it looks like [Twitter-Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-embed/) more closely follows the wording [Twitter follows](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets).
