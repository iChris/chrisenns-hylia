If you've ever asked yourself: "I wonder what Chris found interesting on the web this past week?", I've got the answer for you! I've relaunched my weekly newsletter and you can sign up below or at [chris-enns.ongoodbits.com](https://chris-enns.ongoodbits.com/) to get a weekly email each Friday afternoon of the interesting blog posts, articles, tutorials, YouTube videos, and podcast episodes I came across in the previous week. I'm using a service called [Goodbits](https://goodbits.io/?utm_source=ChrisEnns) that makes it super easy to build email newsletters. Eventually I'll likely roll it into a [Patreon supporters only](https://www.patreon.com/ichris) type email but for now I want to make sure it's something that's easy enough to do and maintain. So if you sign up now, you can likely-maybe-possibly \[footnote\]as long as it's technically possible and not a ton of extra work\[/footnote\] stay subscribed if I flip it over to Patreon patrons only. But you're going to [support me on Patreon right away anyways, right?](https://www.patreon.com/ichris)
