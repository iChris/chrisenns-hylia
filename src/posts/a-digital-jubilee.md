> I’m not a religious man, but I do think there is deep wisdom in tradition and ritual. The Jubilee offers a way out of oppressive expectations, even if they are our own. This year, I’m practicing a digital jubilee by archiving my inbox, deleting my RSS subscriptions, and unfollowing most everyone on Twitter. These, of course, will fill back up as time passes, but now I have a recurring way to purge. Practices like these have been coined “declaring bankruptcy” by the digital lifestyle blogs, but I think the phrase misrepresents the practice. Cleaning the digital slate is not a practice of giving up. It is one of self-forgiveness.

This idea really resonates with me. So if you wake up on January 1 and I'm not following you on Twitter, don't get upset. It's not you, it's me. _Via [Shawnblanc.net](http://shawnblanc.net/2012/12/digital-jubilee/)_
