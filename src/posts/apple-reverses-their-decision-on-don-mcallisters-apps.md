Great news for Don and all his hard work trying to get his apps back in the App Store:

> The bottom line is that Apple will approve the latest app - SCOtutor for iBooks Author - which is the "re-engineered" version of the App, and will re-instate the other older versions of the Apps, but I will need to bring them up to the latest version.

I'll post links as soon as they're back in. **Update** In honour of the app being back on the App Store, Don's made SCOtutor for iBooks Author [free for the time being](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fscotutor-for-ibooks-author%252Fid525238808%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
