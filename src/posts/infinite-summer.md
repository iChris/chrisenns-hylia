![Infinite Summer](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Picture-41.png "Infinite Summer") [Infinitesummer.org](http://infinitesummer.org/) is a site encouraging people to read David Foster Wallace's [Infinite Jest](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0316066524?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclos0a-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=0316066524) this summer.

> Join endurance bibliophiles from around the world in reading Infinite Jest over the summer of 2009, June 21st to September 22nd. A thousand pages รท 92 days = 75 pages a week. No sweat.

Sounds like an interesting challenge. Unfortunately I've already got 4 or 5 books on my 'to read' list that I'm not going to finish this summer. Anyone up for an Infinite Fall/Winter?
