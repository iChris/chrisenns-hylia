Solo performance videos by Bono singing 'So Cruel' and The Edge singing 'Love is Blindless' as a promotion for the [From The Sky Down](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B005SD25WA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclos0a-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=B005SD25WA), the Making of Achtung Baby DVD video that is released tomorrow.

### So Cruel

### Love is Blindness

Bono would do well to bring Edge along and focus on the singing rather than playing guitar, but otherwise a coupe of great acoustic performances of two of my favourite songs from the album.
