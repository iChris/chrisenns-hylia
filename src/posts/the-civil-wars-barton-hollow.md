If you caught their brief performance during Sunday's Grammy awards then you probably already picked up their album. Their album of the same name, Barton Hollow, is [selling on iTunes for only $6.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fbarton-hollow%252Fid443642774%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) right now. Slap it on the same playlist as [Mumford & Sons](https://chrisenns.com/2010/10/mumford-sons-via-bob-lefsetz/) and you've got a great evening of harmonies and great song writing ahead of you.
