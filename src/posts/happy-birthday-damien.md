It was Damien's 3rd birthday yesterday so we had a little supper/birthday cupcake party with his friend Sofia that can't make it to the bigger party on Saturday (_rain, rain, go away, come again after Damien's birthday... party._). ![Goofing Around with Masks](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1133/4731681435_6e8d525d52_m.jpg) Things got a little crazy. Someone spiked the fruit juice with extra sugar and then pulled out some fake glasses with eyebrows on them and it got real nutty in a hurry.
