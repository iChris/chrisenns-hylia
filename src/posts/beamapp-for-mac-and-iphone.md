[BeamApp](http://getbeamapp.com) is a neat little utility that allows you to quickly send map locations and directions form Google Maps, current music playing in iTunes, web page URLs and phone numbers between your iPhone and your Mac. Their marketing line "Stop Sending Emails to Yourself" is precisely why this app could be really useful - I frequently email or text myself something from my iPhone or vice versa rather than manually re-type it.

> Forget about emails you send to yourself just to get a phone number, an address or a hyperlink onto another device. BeamApp analyzes your clipboard, your active application or background tasks on your desktop and opens the right apps on your other gadgets. It connects your technology so you can instantly continue your ongoing action on the device that suits best.

It's a free download for both the Mac and the iPhone:
