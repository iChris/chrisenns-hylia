Omnifocus, ([Mac App Store - $79.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus%252Fid402835630%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)), is the ultimate Mac nerd getting things done app. I have yet to take the plunge, but I know that if and when I do I'll be relying on screencasts like [these from David Sparks](http://www.macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/) to figure out how to really make the most of [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/). When combined with [OmniFocus for iPhone ($19.99)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus-for-iphone%252Fid284885288%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and/or [OmniFocus for iPad ($39.99)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus-for-ipad%252Fid383804552%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), you'll be getting so many things done you won't know what to do with yourself.
