[Photos from the iPhone 4S launch in Hong Kong](http://micgadget.com/17607/3000-people-line-up-for-hong-kong-iphone-4s-launch/). Professional queuers (people paid to line up and buy stuff), regular folks buying 5 iPhone 4S at a time just to turn around and sell them to the gray market as soon as they leave the store, making around $140 per iPhone 4S. Apple tries to do what it can to stop the scalpers and resellers - but you can see how futile it is when nearly everyone is doing it. _Via [512pixels.net](http://512pixels.net/on-hong-kong-and-the-iphone-4s/)._
