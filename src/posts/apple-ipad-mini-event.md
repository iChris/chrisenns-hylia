This is the first even in a long time that Apple has live streamed on the web. In addition to that they’re also streaming to their Apple TV devices so you can watch the event live from the comfort of your couch - which is where I’m watching it. Here’s my notes and observations.

New version of iBooks for iOS
-----------------------------

*   Continuous scrolling
*   Better iCloud integration

MacBooks

iPad
----

*   100 million iPads sold
*   Tablet web traffic is 91% iPad

### iBooks Author

*   New version available today
*   Embedded fonts by publisher
*   Directly insert mathematical expressions

I love that Apple is devoting press time to this app - it means it’s more likely to stick around. I think the potential is huge here for both education publishers as well as self publishers. Getting your own book into the iBook store looking exactly how you want is a great feature and service to offer.

Which iPad to Buy?
------------------

I’m surprised they’ve kept the iPad 2 in their lineup alongside the 4th generation iPad and the new iPad mini - particularly as they touted all the ways the iPad mini improved upon the iPad 2. If someone was asking me, I’d say decide on the size you want and then buy. iPad mini for smaller/portable or iPad with Retina Display. I’d guess it’s because they want to hit certain price points, but the iPad mini with 32GB is only $30 more than the iPad 2 with 16GB - why wouldn’t you go for that if you’ve got $400 burning a hole in your pocket?
