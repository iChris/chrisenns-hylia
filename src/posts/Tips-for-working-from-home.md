My day job is [building websites for clients](http://lemonproductions.ca) and so aside from face to face meetings I can typically work almost anywhere. ![](http://www.minivanmegafun.ca/wp35/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lounging.gif "lounging") Well almost anywhere.

I used to just close the door. We told the kids that if the door was closed, then they weren't allowed to come in. They could knock, but they had to wait for a response. That worked for a few days. But inevitably they would open the door and just come in - particularly the 2 year old who didn't really understand the whole "daddy is working" idea - which would lead to me having to:

*   Pick them up and take them out.
*   Close the door.
*   2 seconds later the door reopens.
