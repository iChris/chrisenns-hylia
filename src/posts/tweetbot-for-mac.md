At [$19.99 in the Mac App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter%252Fid557168941%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) it's not the cheapest Twitter client out there but combined with the [iPhone](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-iphone%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-ipad%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) versions, Tweetbot is the best mobile and desktop Twitter experience with one feature alone, never mind all the other cool stuff:

> Magically sync your timeline read location, direct message read status, and mute filters with Tweetbot for iPhone and iPad via iCloud.

I haven't decided if I'm going to pick up a copy yet. I think they're fully justified in charging $19.99 for an awesome looking app that I'd use everyday to access a service that has provided a good portion of my [business clients](http://www.lemonproductions.ca). I just am unsure about where Twitter is headed as a company and if my money would be better spent on the coming launch of [Netbot for Mac](http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/mac)\[1\].

But with the success they're having with Tweetbot for Mac, it won't take long.
