I had the pleasure of chatting with [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/) on my Welcome to the Internet podcast. He's a smart guy who's written a bunch of [interesting apps, utilities and tools](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/) for those of us who write, code and work on Macs. ![Brett Terpstra](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Brett-Terpstra-600x244.jpg "Brett Terpstra") I don't know if it was something in the air yesterday or what, but I kept tripping over my thoughts and words during the interview. Luckily Brett handled it like a pro and he did a great job of answering my meandering questions.
