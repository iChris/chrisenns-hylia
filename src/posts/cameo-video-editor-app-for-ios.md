Vimeo [acquired and then updated Cameo for iOS](https://vimeo.com/blog/post:747). You can [download it for free in the App Store](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/app/cameo-video-editor-movie-maker/id988821661?mt=8&uo=6&at=10l4Ki).

### Demo Video

https://vimeo.com/130116799 [Direct link to video](https://vimeo.com/130116799) From the demo video it looks like Cameo has an interesting take on editing clips. Zooming in on a clip and editing it directly looks much easier, particularly on a iPhone-sized screen. 9 times out of 10, I just do quick edits on movies in the built-in Photos app and then occasionally fire up [iMovie](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8&uo=6&at=10l4Ki) for something with multiple clips. I usually forgot to use other apps to be honest. But Cameo looks like a good option to keep handy.

### My Video

My main frustration with the app is the inability to add/edit still photos to your projects like you can with other video editing apps like iMovie.
