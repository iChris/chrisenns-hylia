Pretty neat looking email/contact info gathering app that allows for syncing to multiple services including:

*   Apple contacts
*   Google Docs
*   Mailchimp
*   Campaign Monitor
*   Contact Contact

See [full specifications](http://www.guestd.com/specifications.pdf) (PDF).

> Customize your guest book with our original background artworks or use your own. Create background slideshows. Protect your settings and information with a passcode.

It's the kind of app you'd run on your iPad at a trade show, concert or speaking engagement where you want people to be able to sign up for your email list or to be contacted later for updates/promotions on your products. At [$9.99 in the App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fguestd%252Fid500598206%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) it likely needs to be helping you generate some sort of income or marketing presence to justify. Alternatively if you only use [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com), they have a [free iOS app that ties into your mailing list](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fmailchimp%252Fid366794783%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
