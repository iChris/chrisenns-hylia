Chris! Thanks for mentioning my post! I'm glad you liked it... Also, my wife and I lived in Regina for a year when we first got married (in Portland now)... so, not only do we know what it's like to have our lives fall apart in the best way possible, but we also know how to freeze our bunnies off! Thanks again!

@Chase Reeves - Neat! And I see you picked up on our desire to talk about the weather within 5 seconds of starting a conversation with a stranger. :) Are you or your wife Canadian or just were here for a period? Portland sounds like a great city from what little I've heard. Would love to visit someday.

My wife is Canadian, i'm the american in the relationship (there should be at least one in every relationship ;). Portland is great... we love it. Come visit!
