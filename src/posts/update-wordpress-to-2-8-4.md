If you're on a self-hosted WordPress blog and you see a message looking something like this at the top of your login page: ![updatewordpress](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/updatewordpress1.png "updatewordpress") You should probably click it. You'll then see a screen that looks something like this: ![areyousureupdatewp](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/areyousureupdatewp1.png "areyousureupdatewp") Where you should click '**Upgrade Automatically**' and then sit back and watch the magic happen. A few words of caution. If you're not sure if your WordPress blog has some sort of auto-backup of the database, don't click those buttons I told you to click above. My current favorite is the plugin [WP-DB Backup](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-db-backup/) which allows you to email yourself (remember that Gmail account you have with gigs of space you're not using?) a copy of your database on a weekly basis. Just to be safe.
