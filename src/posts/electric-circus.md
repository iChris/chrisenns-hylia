I just posted this on u2log.com, but you can read a report of U2's video shoot for their new single coming out in October called Electric Storm here. In other news, if you like to sit in a hot tub, play pool or watch movies on a big screen tv (on D V D ' s! yack) then you're invited to Mark and my b-day party on Saturday night @8pm. Well, actually you'll have to email me first to get directions... but you get the idea.
