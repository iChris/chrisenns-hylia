John Siracusa on his [road to being a geek](http://hypercritical.co/2014/01/14/the-road-to-geekdom), using his love of the Mac, RC cars and U2 as examples in his own life.

> You don’t have to be a geek about everything in your life—or anything, for that matter. But if geekdom is your goal, don’t let anyone tell you it’s unattainable.

You don’t need to be a member of a particular [social class](http://eviltrout.com/2012/12/30/programming-since-i-was-seven.html), [race](http://pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.htm), [sex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction), or [gender](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/07/26/who-gets-to-be-a-geek-anyone-who-wants-to-be/).
