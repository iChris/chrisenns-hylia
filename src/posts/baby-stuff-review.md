[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2013/01/06/baby-stuff-review) makes one of my favourite iPhone/iPad apps called [Instapaper](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstapaper%252Fid288545208%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and is, to put it mildly, known for being particular. His son is 8 months old and he [posted a list of baby stuff that he and his wife have used](http://www.marco.org/2013/01/06/baby-stuff-review) that they've found to be high quality and work well.
