I got bored of my [old design](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/images/wint04design.html) and since I'm lazy I just went and used a template that someone else built. If I get around to it I'll change the colors and graphics a bit to suit me, but I'm not making any promises. Let me know if there's any broken links or things that look wierd. Off for lunch with Mark.
