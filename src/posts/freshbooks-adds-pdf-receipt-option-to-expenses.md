I use ([and recommend you use](https://chrisenns.com/recommends/freshbooks/)) [FreshBooks](https://lemonproductions.freshbooks.com/refer/www) for invoicing and tracking of expenses at [Lemon Productions](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/) and they just added the ability to import PDFs as a receipt. So scan a copy of your receipt to PDF and attach it to your expense report and then never worry about having to store and find a paper copy of your receipts again.

### Video Version

As an added bonus, keep a copy of all your scanned or photographed receipts in a folder in [your free Dropbox account](http://db.tt/czHe7sK) and you'll have a backup stored in the cloud in case your computer ever disappears. ![FreshBooks screenshot](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FreshBooks-screenshot.jpg "FreshBooks screenshot") Even better, if you take photos of your receipts with a [free Evernote account](http://evernote.com/) on your iPhone and you'll be able to easily search the text of your receipts later thanks to Evernote OCR'ing (recognizing the text in your images) your receipt. \[caption id="attachment\_20434" align="aligncenter" width="741" caption="Searching for Coop in Evernote"\]![Search Evernote for Coop](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Search-Evernote-for-Coop.jpg "Search Evernote for Coop")\[/caption\] Like magic.
