Clarify looks like a great way to organize and prepare screenshots for tutorials and walk throughs - something I'm often doing with [clients](http://lemonproductions.ca).

At [$29.99 in the Mac App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fclarify%252Fid455888980%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) it's not something that's going to replace the simple Command-Shift-3 screenshot utility built into OS X for most people - but if it's something you're doing a lot throughout the day, this will save you a bunch of time. Plus the built in [Dropbox](http://db.tt/czHe7sK) sharing makes it easy to send out to clients who might not have a large email attachment option. Clarify is also available [for Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7](http://www.bluemangolearning.com/clarify/download/). [Here's my quick sample screenshots created with Clarify](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7872/Screenshots/2011-11-23-13h23m/index.html). Riveting.
