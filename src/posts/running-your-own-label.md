Found this via boing-boing: Here's a [blog](http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/) by a guy who's attempting to run his own label that's done under a Creative Commons license so that, in a sense, it's open source music I guess? Interesting article on world musicians who sign their life over to record producers/labels and thus see no money from their recordings. This makes him not-evil.
