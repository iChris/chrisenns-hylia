[A helpful list of FAQ](http://www.imore.com/apple-music-faq) \[footnote\]That's frequently asked questions for you muggles out there. \[/footnote\] about Apple Music - the streaming music service that Apple is launching June 30th, 2015. As an iTunes Match subscriber, I wasn't sure how Apple Music would work alongside/in place of iTunes Match:

> Why would you choose iTunes Match rather than just subscribe to Apple Music? Math, my friends: iTunes Match is just $24.99/year, while an Apple Music subscription runs you $119.98/year. If streaming all of Apple's music collection doesn't appeal to you, but having on-the-go access to your full music library does, iTunes Match appears to be a good alternate option.
