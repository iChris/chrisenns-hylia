[kottke.org](https://kottke.org) was one of the first blogs I remember reading regularly. In [this recent interview titled Last blog standing](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/02/last-blog-standing-last-guy-dancing-how-jason-kottke-is-thinking-about-kottke-org-at-20/), Jason Kottke talks about how blogging compares with other options out there for writers in 2018 as his own blog turns 20: On “the kids” and social media:

> I got the feeling that if it’s not on Facebook and it’s not on Instagram, and it doesn’t involve their friends, they don’t really care that much.

​Using other membership options:

> Whereas if you use Patreon, you go to Patreon.com, you’re in their experience. That’s the other thing I really didn’t like about it; I wanted to keep control over my membership experience. I didn’t want to outsource it to Patreon if in three years they do some sort of Facebook-esque thing and start hosting more and more content on their site so that it becomes more about them and less about the creators. I could just see that happening, and I didn’t want to go anywhere near it.

The blog as his job and as his life:

> I never really got sick of the site. I would every once in a while, but since the membership thing happened, I really like sitting down and going to work for my members. It’s not just that it’s my job. It’s like, I want to do this for them because they have been kind enough to support me. You don’t get that feeling about having advertising on your site. It’s not the same.

​I went to grab the link for his site to write this post and the first article linked was [this one on a video blogger dealing with cancer](https://kottke.org/18/03/a-young-video-blogger-with-cancer-shares-her-story) that I immediately had to watch. Congratulations Jason on getting your “one-man-band” to [Twenty.](https://kottke.org/18/03/twenty)
