1\. Watch This
--------------

I love me some Apple stuff as much as the next Apple nerd. But I'm really not sure about the watch. Reviews are trickling out and it seems mixed. Is this the next iPhone or the next Newton?

*   "There’s an inherent tiny amount of lag that isn’t there with a regular watch." [John Gruber of Daring Fireball's review](http://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch).
*   "It just has to answer one question: would you actually use the Apple Watch instead of your phone?" [Nilay Patel at The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review).

2\. My Company Sucks
--------------------

Technically I am my boss. But how would I tell myself if I'm not doing a great job if I asked myself for an evaluation of my abilities? Chris Coyier gives a great response to a reader's question in "[I Don't Like Our Company's Process. How do I Tell My Boss?](https://css-tricks.com/i-dont-like-our-companies-process-how-do-i-tell-my-boss/)"

  
3\. Messenger In a Website
-----------------------------

If Facebook.com is too much Facebook for you, you might be interested in the news that [Facebook Launched Messenger for Web Browsers](http://recode.net/2015/04/08/facebook-launches-messenger-for-web-browsers/).  
  
I'm curious how much Zuckerberg paid for [Messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com).

4\. Optimize Now
----------------

More and more of the internet is being viewed on mobile. There's a good chance you're reading this on your iPhone, Android tablet or Blackberry...  thing?   
  
[Speeding Up WordPress with Image Optimization](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/speeding-up-wordpress-image-optimization--cms-22057) contains a bunch of tips for minimizing, optimizing and smush'izing your WordPress blog.

5\. Spacebars and Semicolons
----------------------------

[Apple released an update for Yosemite](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/04/08/yosemite-10-10-3-photos-emoji-released/), 10.10.3, with a brand new Photos app that Apple hopes will crop iPhoto from your memory. I've been testing it on the beta version of OS X for a month and I think it's an improvement - particularly with iCloud Photo support.   
  
There's also an iOS update for your iPhone or iPad - iOS 8.3 - that has [emoji updates, wireless CarPlay and space bar UI fixes](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/04/08/apple-releases-ios-8-3/). My thumbs are too fat and frequently mash the space bar when I meant to hit a letter C. Your mileage may vary.  
  
One final iPhone tip from David Sparks: If you have any contacts with extensions in their phone number, [David's got a magical way to make your iPhone behave using a simple semicolon](http://macsparky.com/blog/2015/4/the-iphone-extension-trick).

6\. Laugh It Up Fuzzball
------------------------

Star Wars is finally making it's way to iTunes. To digital. [At $24.99CDN each, it’s not cheap to pick up the entire set](https://chrisenns.com/2015/04/stars-wars-coming-to-digital-hd-on-itunes/). Are you going to dress up as Luke to line up in front of your computer to buy it?

7\. Laugh If You're Furious
---------------------------

Mallory Ortberg ends this edition of the newsletter with [Reasons Why She's Furious With Everyone Today](http://the-toast.net/2015/04/08/reasons-why-i-am-furious-with-everyone-today/).  
  
And now I'm going to go eat my apple.
