Atari has released an app for the iPhone/iPad called [Atari's Greatest Hits](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fataris-greatest-hits%252Fid422966028%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) (_iTunes affiliate link_) that comes with one game - Pong. You can then, using in app purchases, buy packs of other games ($0.99 for 4 games) or all 100 games for $14.99. You owe it to your children and your children's children to install this app and show them our history, our heritage, where we came from. And then if you're really serious, pick up an [iCade](http://www.thinkgeek.com/electronics/retro-gaming/e762/) to plug your iPad into and show them how it was really played back in the day.
