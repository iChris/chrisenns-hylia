Spotted via [Federico Viticci on Twitter](https://twitter.com/viticci/status/484698966588936192), [Day One for iOS is free right now](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/day-one-journal-diary/id421706526?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki). Day One is a great journaling app that's only drawback is that you still have to write your journal articles yourself. Which you really can't fault it for. If you enjoy it on your iPhone or iPad, be sure to give the [Mac version a spin](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/day-one/id422304217?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki).[](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/day-one-journal-diary/id421706526?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
