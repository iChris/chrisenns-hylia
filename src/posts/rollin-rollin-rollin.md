Mennoboy is on the move. We're in the process of switching hosts to more space, theoretically better servers and that kind of thing. There may be disruptions in our email/web sites over the weekend and into next week. If you're sending an email to a mennoboy (or mennogirl) and it bounces, just keep trying until it goes through. That or pick up the phone and call. Crazy thought, hey?
