I'm not great at doing the self promotional bits but it needs to be done every so often so that my mum[1](#fn-20033:1) knows where to keep up with all the technical stuff her favourite son is up to.

Facebook
--------

There's a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863) for this blog that basically just gets a post every time I update this site. If Facebook is your bag, then [like away](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863). I actually need a few more folks to like it so I can get a less ugly Facebook name than [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863) so feel free to like it even if you don't, you know, actually like it?

Twitter
-------

It's probably a bit backwards but the official Twitter account for this blog is [@chrisenns](https://twitter.com/#!/chrisenns), where my personal Twitter account is [@iChris](https://twitter.com/#!/ichris). But that's just the way it is. The [@chrisenns](https://twitter.com/#!/chrisenns) account is just an auto-tweet with a link of every post that goes out on this site. So again, if Twitter is your preferred way to keep up with sites these days, [@chrisenns](https://twitter.com/#!/chrisenns) is where to follow along.

RSS Subscriptions
-----------------

Still my preferred way of keeping up with websites/blogs, but I know it's on the outs for a lot of people in favour of the above methods. But if you'd like to subscribe to the site with an RSS reader, [http://feeds.feedburner.com/mennoboy-chris](http://feeds.feedburner.com/mennoboy-chris) is the address to use. Your traditional RSS feed with everything posted, full article in the feed the way it should be and links back to the site/etc.

Other Stuff
-----------

*   I periodically update my [recommends page](https://chrisenns.com/recommends/) with stuff I recommend to folks online.
*   Lemon Productions, my web consulting business, is located at [http://www.lemonproductions.ca/](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/), or [@lemonproduction on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/lemonproduction) , [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lemonproductionsca) and [RSS subscription](http://feeds.feedburner.com/lemonproductionsblog)
*   SSKTN is where I post podcasts. [ssktn.com](http://ssktn.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ssktn), [@ssktn on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/ssktn) and [the various links to iTunes for the podcasts themselves](http://ssktn.com/subscribe/).

Thanks
------

Thanks for reading, listening, liking and commenting. I really do appreciate and value the little community that gets involved in the stuff I do. Some days it can feel like I'm operating in a vacuum and the comments on my blog, replies on Twitter or feedback for SSKTN all help to remind me why I enjoy this stuff so much. Ok, enough mushy stuff. Back to Apple fanboy/grumpy tech nerd postings.

1.  I really prefer the British spelling of mum. Something about it seems more warm and fuzzy than mom. Although it may just be that I really wish I had a British accent. [↩](#fnref-20033:1)
