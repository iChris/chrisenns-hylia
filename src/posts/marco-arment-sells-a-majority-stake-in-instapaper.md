Given the success of [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org), hard not to see this happening soon. From [the post on Marco's blog](http://www.marco.org/2013/04/25/instapaper-next-generation):

> I’m happy to announce that I’ve sold a majority stake in Instapaper to [Betaworks](http://betaworks.com/). We’ve structured the deal with Instapaper’s health and longevity as the top priority, with incentives to keep it going well into the future. I will continue advising the project indefinitely, while Betaworks will take over its operations, expand its staff, and develop it further.

I was actually thinking about where Instapaper was headed a little while ago and recently had tried out [Pocket](http://getpocket.com), which is an Instapaper competitor/clone. I really like Instapaper but it has felt like the iOS app ([Instapaper in the App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Finstapaper%252Fid288545208%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) hasn't seen the design love that something like The Magazine has gotten. I'll keep using Instapaper until there's something about it that either pushes me away or a feature in another app that draws me in. For now I don't feel like there's any reason to change and I trust Marco's judgement in who he has sold Instapaper to that they won't destroy what he's built any time soon.
