I'm putting together an order of a print from [Stanley Chow](http://stanleychow.bigcartel.com/) - anyone want to add anything to the order to save him/us on shipping it across the pond? [![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lostintranslationweb-204x300.jpg "lostintranslationweb")](http://stanleychow.bigcartel.com/product/for-relaxing-times-suntory-time) As thanks for interviewing him for [Welcome to the Internet](http://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/012-welcome-to-the-internet-stanley-chow/), he sent me a copy of his tribute to [The Sound of Music](http://stanleychow.bigcartel.com/product/mr-mrs-von-trapp-a2) and I can attest to the quality of both the design and the print. Beautiful stuff. Hit me up on [the contact page](/contact/) with your details if you're interested. Can you guess which poster finally pushed me over _the edge_ to order something?
