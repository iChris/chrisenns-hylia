This [post is consistently among my top requested](https://chrisenns.com/2008/07/17/current-ipod-touch-screen-layout/) posts so I figured I might as well update it to current apps: [![Current iPod touch Screen (2010-02-09)](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2705/4343681507_5a4b676696.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/4343681507/ "Current iPod touch Screen (2010-02-09)") I'm embarrassed to show you that Foursquare and Facebook are on there, but otherwise I'm proud to show off the apps I use most often. Any that you're using that you don't see there and why?
