A bit short on what actually goes on in a day at the new space, but ReadWrite's [article on the new facility YouTube has built for video creators](http://readwrite.com/2013/01/25/a-day-in-the-life-at-youtubes-fancy-new-la-studio) is interesting none the less.

There's big money on the table for Wong. And he's taking it. YouTube is letting Freddie build a new soundstage for season two of his scripted series, [Video Game High School](http://www.rocketjump.com/category/vghs). And it didn't even have to spend a penny.
