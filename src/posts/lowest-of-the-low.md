I was never a big fan of INXS, but I have to agree with [Caroline](http://www.prolific.org/) that this is sinking to a new low in an attempt to gain fading popularity. [INXS are searching for a new lead singer through a Mark Burnett (Survivor, The Apprentice, other reality cash cows) led reality show called Rock Star.](http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/15/music.inxs.reut/index.html)
