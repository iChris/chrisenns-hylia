I posted about the start of this series back in [March 2013](https://chrisenns.com/2013/03/damsel-in-distress-part-1-tropes-vs-women-in-video-games/) and it's now 7 videos in to the series ([YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn4ob_5_ttEaA_vc8F3fjzE62esf9yP61)) and every episode is worth watching for the very well researched commentary on the way women have been presented in video games. With the release of the most recent episode (embedded below or [watch on YouTube here](http://youtu.be/5i_RPr9DwMA?list=PLn4ob_5_ttEaA_vc8F3fjzE62esf9yP61)) series creator Anita Sarkeesian [has been receiving all sorts of nasty threats and comments from scared little men/boys](http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/27/6075179/anita-sarkeesian-says-she-was-driven-out-of-house-by-threats):

> Since the project launched on Kickstarter way back in 2012, the gaming community has been treated to an incessant, deeply paranoid campaign against Tropes vs. Women generally and Sarkeesian personally. This includes a flood of violent comments and emails, videos documenting ways in which she's not a "real gamer," a game in which you can punch her in the face, and a proposed documentary devoted to exposing the "lies" and "campaign of misinformation" from what is, again, a collection of opinions about video games. Also, now, she's apparently spent the night with friends after contacting law enforcement about "some very scary threats" against her and her family.

I cannot fathom how one human being can think it's a rational response to someone's video on YouTube to threaten said person's life and their family. It's one thing to disagree vehemently and get angry and shout "you stupid head" at person in a comment box. But to be **so** threatened by a woman's opinion about video games. That's some serious crazy. You can combat the crazy by [donating to Feminist Frequency](http://www.feministfrequency.com/donate/) or [watch the series](http://youtu.be/5i_RPr9DwMA?list=PLn4ob_5_ttEaA_vc8F3fjzE62esf9yP61) and like/share it to provoke some discussion among your gamer friends.
