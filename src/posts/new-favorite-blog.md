[Mark Cuban's blog](http://www.blogmaverick.com/) is quickly becoming one of my favorites. He recently talked about how he got his money ([part 1](http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/7324322564475288/),[part 2](http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/4622841295227252/)) and in his most recent entry, he [calls out The Don](http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/7661336245723213/) to have a corporate meetup at Whitecastle. I think Mark should hire me to do a reality blog on his life. I'll just follow him around with a camera so when other famous people try to schmooz him and he calls them on it, he can back it up with video footage.
