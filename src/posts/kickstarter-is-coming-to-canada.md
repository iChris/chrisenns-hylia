Opening up later this summer. [Sign up now to be notified](http://www.kickstarter.com/canada). It'll be interesting to see what payment processor they work with. In the US Kickstarter uses Amazon to handle all the verifying and credit card processing. I'm hoping for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca) but maybe they've worked out all the details with Amazon Canada.
