I first posted about The Civil Wars [back in February](https://chrisenns.com/2012/02/the-civil-wars-barton-hollow/) after their little cameo on the Grammy awards. Today they were on [Q](http://www.cbc.ca/q/), a Canadian radio talk show: [The Civil Wars perform 'I've Got This Friend' on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYVS8hE9sYA) If you didn't pick it up back in February, I'd still recommend [grabbing a copy of Barton Hollow, their debut album, off iTunes](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fbarton-hollow%252Fid443642774%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or wherever you buy music. At $7.99CDN it's a steal. If you're too cheap to buy the whole album, at least pick up [Barton Hollow for $0.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fbarton-hollow%252Fid443642774%253Fi%253D443642784%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). Your ears will thank you.
