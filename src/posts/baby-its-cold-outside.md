Man is it ever cold out there. Sue's making soup and I'm trying to fight off a cold. Ever have one of those days where the thoughts in your head don't sound nearly as intelligent when you let them out of your mouth?

Like a lot of Apple product, I have no direct use for it but I still desperately want one.
