TeeVee 2 is an iPhone app that you punch in the tv shows you watch and it'll let you know when a new episode is on next, as well as give you cast bios and other random trivia/info about the show. A beautiful app for alerting you when Game of Thrones makes it's return. [TeeVee 2 is free right now in the App Store (regularly $0.99)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fteevee-2-your-tv-shows-guru%252Fid663975743%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
