Damien got to meet his distant cousins-in-law-twice-removed-etc. [![Courtney and Damien 2](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1151/829869898_7783e8b510_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/829869898/) [![Courtney and Damien 1](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1110/829868786_2c354d4adb_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/829868786/) A tad ironic since Courtney used to cry when we were looking after them a few years back. I told Damien to cry when she was holding him. Worked like a charm.
