![It Might Get Loud](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Picture-2-300x221.png "It Might Get Loud") I really hope this will be in a local theatre. [Trailer here](http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/itmightgetloud/) on Apple's trailer site. **Update June 22**: [The Lefsetz Letter](http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/06/22/it-might-get-loud/) reviews It Might Get Loud.

> "It Might Get Loud" is a summit meeting between three legendary guitarists, Jack White, the Edge and the aforementioned Mr. Page. They ultimately unite for a confab on a soundstage in Burbank, where they ruminate on where they’re coming from and eventually play a great take on "In My Time Of Dying" and a superfluous, weak "The Weight". And in between, we go into each of the three’s roots.
