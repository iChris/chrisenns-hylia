I write in Markdown on this blog. I use it when I record notes for [podcasts I record](http://ssktn.com) and when I'm taking notes in [conversations for my day job](http://lemonproductions.ca). It's so quick to write when you work in a web/real world hybrid like I do. There's the [version in the iBookstore](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fbook%252Fmarkdown%252Fid622433972%253Fmt%253D11%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and there's also [a PDF version available if you're not a iOS user](http://macsparky.fetchapp.com/sell/liexohbo).
