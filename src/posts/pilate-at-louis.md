Joel gave his right eye to see Pilate last night. I gave up 2 hours of my life listening to 2 other crappy bands (Boy and Memory Bank) before finally getting to the good stuff. It was akin to having to wade through mushroom-capped something appetizers to get to your steak. But man was it a good steak. Mmmm.... steak.
