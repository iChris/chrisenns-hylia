*   8 people filled it out and said they werenâ€™t buying so I removed their details from the results
*   I'm surprised that half the respondents are getting a 64GB model. I've been using a 32GB iPhone 4 for 2 years and I keep getting more space back as Apple adds features like iTunes Match and Photo Stream. But I guess apps are only going to get bigger and with a better camera, you'd be shooting that much more video and photos.
*   An even split on buying in-store versus pre-ordering.
*   Plenty of iPhone 4's being upgraded which makes sense. Anytime you skip a generation, the 4S in this case, you're going to see dramatic improvements across the board.

### What About Me?

As I mentioned above, I'm using a 2 year old 32GB iPhone 4. I've got a year left on my Telus contract so I'd be looking at $180 to upgrade plus the price of a iPhone 5 (_Black 32GB is what I'd do if you're wondering_) so it's just not worth it to me to upgrade and throw away $180. If anything, our family is going to need to upgrade my wife's iPad 1. With iOS 6 coming soon, the iPad 1 isn't able to run it and so she'll start to miss out on some of the newer features as they get added. Plus iOS 5 is running so slow on the iPad 1 that we'd be looking to upgrade even if there wasn't the iOS 6 issue. So that's where, if anywhere, our gadget upgrade money will go in the near future.

Thanks to all that bothered to fill out the survey. I really do appreciate you satisfying my nerdy curiosity about what the readers of this blog are doing with their tech/nerd money.
