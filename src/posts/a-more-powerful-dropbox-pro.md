I love when services I use get better without having to pay more: [Introducing a more powerful Dropbox Pro](https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/08/introducing-more-powerful-dropbox-pro/):

> Whether you’re a professor sending out your lesson plans, a musician creating and sharing your new composition, or a consultant writing and refining a proposal, Dropbox Pro provides a home for your passion and creativity. Today, we’re making that home even more powerful and roomier!

The big news for most folks is the $10/month plan now includes 1TB of space. Other new features include:

*   Passwords for shared links
*   Expirations for shared links
*   View-only permissions for shared folders
*   Remote wipe is the ability to wipe a device's Dropbox files like a laptop or iOS device in the event it gets stolen.
