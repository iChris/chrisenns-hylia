From Harry McCracken, [photographer at MacWorld when Jobs announced the original MacBook Air](http://technologizer.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-1955-2011/).  
  
The look of satisfaction and joy on Jobs' face is exactly the look you can see every time someone opens a box of Apple hardware for the first time.  
  
The revealing of how something as inane as a bunch of chips and wires and silicon can be presented as something to be enjoyed and appreciated.
