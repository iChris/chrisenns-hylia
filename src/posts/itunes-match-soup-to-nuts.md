I hadn't really heard the phrase _[soup to nuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_to_nuts)_ until I started listening to the odd [Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu) podcasts with [David Sparks](http://5by5.tv/person/david-sparks) & [Katie Floyd](http://5by5.tv/person/katie-floyd) - maybe it's more common among lawyers?[1](#fn-19944:1) In [episode 66 of Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu/66) David & Katie do a _soup to nuts_ walk through of the process of switching over to [iTunes Match](http://www.apple.com/ca/itunes/whats-new/) on your Mac and iOS devices. ![iTunes Match](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/itunesmatch.jpg "iTunes Match") Normally with these kinds of things I just hit the sign-up button and let the computer do it's thing. But when it comes to my 4,300+ song music library, I get a little picky and worry about things disappearing such as playlists, play counts, and other metadata that is stored in all those MP3s & M4a files. So if you're like me and want to know what's going to happen when you click the sign-up button, [listen to the podcast](http://5by5.tv/mpu/66).
