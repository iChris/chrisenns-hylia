You'll need to be running OS 10.6.6 which is available through software update (_Go to the Apple in the top left corner of your screen, click 'Software Update' and you're off to the races_). ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Appstore-Icon.png "App store Icon") After a reboot you'll have a new app icon sitting in your dock. **Initial thoughts**: I can't wait until the next piece of software I need to help my dad install and I can just send him a link and say "buy this." Definitely makes life much easier to buy and install applications on a Mac. **Recommended first apps**: [Twitter for Mac is free](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12), [The Incident is a great little game that I play on the iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id408679233?mt=12) as is [Angry Birds](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/angry-birds/id403961173?mt=12). The really great thing is now you can buy individual apps within Apple's iLife and iWork suite - so [iPhoto is only $14.99](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/iphoto/id408981381?mt=12) and you don't have to get iMovie or Garageband if you don't ever use them.
