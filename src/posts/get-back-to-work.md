If you can put up with the occasional tangent and weird 70s/80s cultural references, Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin have been putting out great episodes of [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w). ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/b2w-thumb.jpg "bw2") The one line bio:

> Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin on productivity, communication, work, barriers, constraints, tools, and more.

Episode 7, [Vocational Wheel](http://5by5.tv/b2w/7), was just released.

> Go fail at something interesting, just for fun...
