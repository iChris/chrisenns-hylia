Speaking of [how to get started podcasting](https://chrisenns.com/2015/01/tools-gear-and-hardware-for-a-first-time-podcaster/), [Justin Jackson](http://www.twitter.com/mijustin) is 5 episodes in to his new podcast called [Build and Launch](http://buildandlaunch.net) - his plan is to launch a new mini-product/service each week in February - but as part of his launch week for the podcast he's spent the first 5 episodes talking about how he's recording his podcast:

*   [EP1: Donâ€™t make stuff for hippies](http://buildandlaunch.net/1/)
*   [EP2: A ton of coffee and feeling good](http://buildandlaunch.net/2/)
*   [EP3: Podcasting gear starter kit](http://buildandlaunch.net/3/)
*   [EP4: How do you say creeper in French?](http://buildandlaunch.net/4/)
*   [EP5: Re-launch my beard](http://buildandlaunch.net/5/)

Justin's been a frequent guest on [Goodstuff](http://goodstuff.fm) shows and is always entertaining. He's done a great job of giving advice on setting up a podcast - I particularly dig his use of his family to give perspective on what he's trying to do. Something I'll have to try and incorporate more on [Daily(ish)](http://goodstuff.fm/dailyish/) if my family is willing.
