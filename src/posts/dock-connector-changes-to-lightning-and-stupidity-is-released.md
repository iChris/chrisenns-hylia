Apple's dock connector has been [around for over 10 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod#Connectivity). To change it now is not "testing the patience" of their fans. It's making a choice to get rid of a bigger connection for a smaller one - which in turn allows Apple to design a better phone - and eventually iPad. CNNMoney is also wrong with their assertion that [Apple's $30 Lightning adapter won't work with old speakers](http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/13/technology/apple-lightning-adapter/index.html) (_Link via [@danfrakes](https://twitter.com/danfrakes/statuses/246360845108535296)_). Just have to ask Apple: https://twitter.com/danfrakes/statuses/246359997137682432 Read all about the Lightning connector at Macworld's article "[What Apple's new Lightning connector means for you](http://www.macworld.com/article/1168555/what_apples_new_lightning_connector_means_for_you.html)".

### Apple's Greed

Yes, Apple will make money by selling new adapters. Apple has made money on a variety of adapters over the years, as do most tech companies. Apple often [1](#fn-20737:1) attempts to make money from the products it sells. But if you think that Apple is going to hang on to a 30 pin adapter because other companies profited heavily from selling devices based on that adapter, then you clearly haven't been following along with Apple's story long enough. A list of a few other things Apple has changed because they felt it was best for their customers in the long run:

*   Ditching the floppy drive while "everyone" was still using it.
*   Moving to USB when hardly anyone had any USB devices.
*   Getting rid of DVD/CD drives in most of their portables.
*   Doing away with boxed software and selling direct to customers via the Mac App Store.
*   Music industry, movie industry, etc.

The cynic says Apple does it to make money. And that's partially true. The irrational Apple fan says it's just part of _the experience_ of owning a Mac. The truth is somewhere in between.
