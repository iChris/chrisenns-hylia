Today is the last day to get Carcassonne for only $4.99. Sometime tomorrow they are releasing an update to make it native on the iPad as well as the iPhone 4 and with the update, the price apparently will be going up to $9.99.

And even though I routinely get trounced by everyone I play it with, I'd still highly recommend you pick up a copy.
