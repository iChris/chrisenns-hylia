There's a lot of interesting reading floating around the net in the wake of the arrest of Jose Padillo in connection with 'dirty bombs' being planned for the states. I'm sure you can find plenty of conspiracy theories on your own, but something I find interesting about it all is this: Regardless of what's really happening, that alone just makes everything look slimy. BTW if you enjoy some good conspiracy theories, check out the site where I grabbed this info from: www.whatreallyhappened.com. Just remember there's at least two sides to every story. Be sure to check out this article as well.
