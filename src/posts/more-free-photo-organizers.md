I think [Picasa](http://www.picasa.com/content/download.php?sourceid=awd&subid=ha-picbd&cv=1) is still the best iPhoto clone out there for Windows users, but Microsoft has just released [Photo Story 3](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx) for free for anyone using WinXP. Someone on a WinXP box try it out and let me know how well it works. It's getting [rave reviews on some blogs](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/28.html#a8529), but then he works for Microsoft.
