Lost amid all the other new stuff yesterday from Apple was a fairly major update to Final Cut Pro X:

> The latest version (10.0.6) of the video editing software now supports native RAW editing of content from RED cameras, lets you expand multichannel audio files so you can edit each audio channel separately and adds a paste attributes window that lets you choose specific effects to copy between clips.

Motion and Compressor also saw updates.
