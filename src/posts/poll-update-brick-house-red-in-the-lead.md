![Design Poll](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-3-300x158.png "Design Poll") So far 40% of you prefer the Brick House Red look. I'll close the poll at the end of this week so [go vote if you haven't already](https://chrisenns.com/2009/08/20/new-theme-old-theme/) - or if you're on a different computer than your first vote - vote again!
