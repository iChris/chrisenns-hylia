Seems like a good pairing for this Saskatchewan winter. [Expedition Edition Field Notes notebooks](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/expedition/):

> But the real innovation here is the paper. Itâ€™s maybe not even fair to call it paper. The whole book is printed on [Yupo Synthetic paper](http://www.yupousa.com/paper/index.php), an amazing water- and tear-proof paper extruded from polypropylene pellets in Chesapeake, Virginia.

Be sure to check out the 12 "scientific" test videos on [the site](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/expedition/).
