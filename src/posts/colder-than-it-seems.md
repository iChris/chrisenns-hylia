13/14 degrees seemed kinda nice - nice enough to go for a bike ride over lunch anyways. What I failed to notice was the 30km/h winds that were blowing at -10 degrees. Frig. And it's supposed to go below 0 tonight. Summer's beginning to look waaaaay too similair to that other season we have that starts with a 'W'!
