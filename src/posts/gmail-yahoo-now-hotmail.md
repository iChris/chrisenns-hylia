It's great to see a little healthy competition still works: [Hotmail is bumping up their storage levels to 250MB](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/aplocal_story.asp?category=6420&slug=Microsoft%20Hotmail) and adding enhanced virus scanning. Still doesn't have the 'coolness' of Google's gmail, but at least it removes the storage issue.
