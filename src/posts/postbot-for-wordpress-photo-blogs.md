Great new service from the folks behind WordPress called [Postbot](https://postbot.co):

> Postbot will create a post for each photo and schedule it to appear at a certain time over a given number of days. This is the ideal way to share a lot of photos without having to manually create and schedule each one. When everything is ready just pick a schedule — a start date and the number of days between each photo — and we’ll do the rest. If you want to exclude the weekends then that’s fine too.

In order to use Postbot on a self-hosted WordPress site, you'll need to have the [Jetpack plugin](http://jetpack.me/) installed with the [JSON API enabled](http://jetpack.me/support/json-api/). The obvious use for Postbot would be for a photography blog, but using it on a regular blog to interject photos could be a great way to keep the site fresh without having to manually post something as often.
