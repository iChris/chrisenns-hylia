Remember that fancy touch screen computer that Microsoft [debuted awhile back](https://chrisenns.com/2007/06/21/microsoft-surface/)? Check out [this post describing how easy it is to setup](http://kinesismomentum.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/skin-deep-usability/) - including the fact that you have to use a keyboard and mouse to set it up. Nice! _Via [daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/24/microsoft-surface)_
