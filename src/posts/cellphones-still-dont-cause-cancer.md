A [Danish study](http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d6387) has shown there's no casual association between cell phone use and an increased risk of brain tumours. It's one of those things though, like air travel, that society seems to have in it's head as true no matter how many studies come out to contradict the truthiness of the thought. I mean, you're putting a thing that receives and sends invisible bits of data right next to your head - that has to do something bad, right? _Via [Boingboing.net](http://boingboing.net/2011/10/21/cellphones-still-dont-cause-cancer.html)_
