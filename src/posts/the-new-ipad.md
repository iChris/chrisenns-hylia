![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Resolutionary-725x404.png "Resolutionary") You can [watch the video of the keynote](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/123pibhargjknawdconwecown/event/index.html) or [visit Apple's website for the new iPad](http://www.apple.com/ca/ipad/). No iPad 2S, 2HD, 3, iPad HDx2, etc. naming convention here. Just simply the new iPad. Which is exactly what everyone will be calling it. I suspect the next iPhone will follow suite and be called simply 'the new iPhone'.

Support for 1080P video, upgraded user interface, iTunes Match, improved iCloud support with movies you've purchased, Photo Stream so that pictures you take on an iPhone/iPad are automagically on your Apple TV. ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AppleTV-2012-725x488.png "AppleTV 2012")

Should You Buy The New iPad?
----------------------------

If you already have a previous iPad, whether version 1 or 2, and you don't want to upgrade then just don't ever look at the new iPad's retina display. If it's anything like the difference between an iPhone 3GS and an iPhone 4 - once you see the new display your old iPad's screen will look pixellated and fuzzy, particularly when viewing text. **Reality Distortion Field Version**: If you don't already have an iPad and have been holding out, this is the version to finally [take the leap and jump in with](http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad). **Normal Reality Version**: You'll be fine without an iPad, new or otherwise. Pick up a used iPad 1 or 2 to play with iOS if you're curious. The iPad really is a world-changing device whether you buy one or not. Especially when you consider it didn't even exist 2 years ago.
