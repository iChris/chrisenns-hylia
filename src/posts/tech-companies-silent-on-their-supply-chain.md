From The New York Times, [an article](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/disruptions-on-worker-conditions-apples-rivals-are-silent/) on all the focus on Apple while other companies hope nobody asks them about their supply chain. Too late.

> In the last week I have asked Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Microsoft and others about their reports on labor conditions. Most responded with a boilerplate public relations message. Some didnâ€™t even respond.

The other companies include Barnes & Noble, Dell, Lenovo, & Amazon. _Via [daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/09/foxconn-silent)_
