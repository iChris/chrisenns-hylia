[Watch the video here.](http://www.worldonfire.ca/) Hearts are worn In these dark ages You're not alone, In these stories' pages The light has fallen Amongst the living and the dying And I'll try to hold it in Yeah I'll try to hold it in The world is on fire It's more than I can handle I'll tap into the water Try and bring my share Try to bring more, more than I can handle Bring it to the table Bring what I am able ... I watch the heavens But I find no calling Something I can do to change what's coming Stay close to me While the sky is falling I don't wanna be left alone, Don't want to be alone... The world is on fire It's more than I can handle I'll tap into the water Try and bring my share Try to bring more, more than I can handle Bring it to the table Bring what I am able ... Hearts break ... hearts mend ... love still hurts visions clash ... planes crash Still there's talk of saving souls Still the cold is closing in on us We part the veil on our killer sun Stray from the straight line On this short run ... The more we take the less we become The fortune of one man means less for some The world is on fire It's more than I can handle I'll tap into the water Try and bring my share Try to bring more, more than I can handle Bring it to the table Bring what I am able ... The world is on fire It's more than I can handle I'll tap into the water Try and bring my share Try to bring more, more than I can handle Bring it to the table Bring what I am able .. - Sarah McLachlan - 'World on Fire'
