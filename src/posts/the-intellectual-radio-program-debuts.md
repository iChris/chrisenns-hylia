I'm pumped to announce the new show I've launched with myself, Adam Clark and Tim Smith called [The Intellectual Radio Program](http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/) - tongue firmly placed in cheek obviously. [![Intellectual-Radio-Program](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Intellectual-Radio-Program-600x600.png)](http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/) In [episode 1 of the show titled "Punch You in the Targaryens"](http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/1/), we talk about Time Warner pulling a CBS blackout and then reversing their decision, Netflix setting up viewer accounts within a family, and Marco Arment’s post about what having internet fame gets you in terms of sales in the App Store. We spend the last half of the show talking through episodes 1 and 2 of Game of Thrones, season 1. Plenty of spoilers abound so you’ve been warned. [Take a listen](http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/1/) and then be sure to [subscribe in iTunes and leave a rating or review while you're there](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/intellectual-radio-program/id682246844) - it helps us get the show out to more people if we get a review. Especially the 5 star reviews.
