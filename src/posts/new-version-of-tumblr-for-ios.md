v3.3 update for [Tumblr for iOS](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftumblr%252Fid305343404%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).

### Update includes:

*   Shoot with a brand new camera
*   Create photosets
*   Double tap anywhere on a post to â™¥!

See it in action [over on my tumblr](http://tumblr.chrisenns.com/post/45126710040/new-photosets-in-tumblr-for-ios). I love how quick and easy Tumblr is to use and read. For content creators and people who just view content, Tumblr is such a great platform to be on. I'm just too much of a finicky nerd who likes to mess around with stuff to give my whole blog over to it.[](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftumblr%252Fid305343404%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)
