I bought this game for our computer after seeing it in the arcades. Incredible that what used to run as a series of laserdisc movie sequences - kind of like a choose your own adventure DVD - is now able to run on a 0.5" thick **cell phone**. Check out this quote from Newsweek in 1983:

> Dragon's Lair is this summer's hottest new toy: the first arcade game in the United States with a movie-quality image to go along with the actionâ€¦ The game has been devouring kids' coins at top speed since it appeared early in July. Said Robert Romano, 10, who waited all day in the crush at Castle Park without getting to play, "It's the most awesome game I've ever seen in my life."
