When I've posted about Pixelmator in the past ([here](https://chrisenns.com/2013/05/pixelmator-update/), [here](https://chrisenns.com/2012/11/pixelmator-on-for-half-price/), and [here](https://chrisenns.com/recommends/mac-apps/)) I've gotten the question of "Can you replace Photoshop with Pixelmator" and I keep meaning to write up my thoughts - which I still haven't done. But while you're waiting you can read a [better response by Michael Cohen over at TidBITS](http://tidbits.com/article/13775):

> The answer to that, I’m afraid, may disappoint those who want cut-and-dried answers to complex questions: it depends on how you use Photoshop, and what you use it for. In my case, and in the cases of other members of the TidBITS staff whom I asked, the answer seems to be “Yes.”
