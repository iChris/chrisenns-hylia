I just installed the Movabletype upgrade to v3.14. Any mennoboys or mennogirls that experience any issues, [drop me a line](mailto:chris.enns@mac.com). Any Mac users out there who use Movabletype and are missing out on the shortcut link, bold, email, etc buttons on their entry page need to check out [Firefox](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=0&t=76). Even if all you use it for is your blog entries, it's a good browser to have around. Something in the javascript support in Safari renders those shortcut buttons invisible.
