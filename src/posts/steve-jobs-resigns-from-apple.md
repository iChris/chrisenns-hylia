Just as I was about to hit publish on my previous post about leaving my job, I saw on Twitter people starting to post about Steve Jobs [resigning from Apple](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-bw-19285464.html). Not that there's any similarity to me and him in terms of accomplishments, etc. Just was a bit freaky to have happen at the same time. It's sad news because it's likely due to health issues getting too bad to be able to carry on. Definitely thinking of him and his family at this time. As [@mrgan said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/mrgan/status/106497844466298882), ![Note to all decent people: do not read Internet comments on the news about Steve Jobs. I just did it for 5 seconds and I hate everyone.](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-24-at-4.56.11-PM.png "Screen Shot 2011-08-24 at 4.56.11 PM")
