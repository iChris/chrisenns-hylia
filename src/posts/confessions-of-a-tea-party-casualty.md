US politics boggles my mind. I'm sure this kind of stuff is going to start happening more up north here in Canada since we seem to try and beg/borrow/steal the worst of what America has to offer. But there's some **seriously crazy** folks down there in the _United_ States.

> I refused to use the word because I have this view that the Ninth Commandment must mean something. I remember one year Bill Clinton—the guy I was out to get \[when serving on the House judiciary committee in the 1990s\]—at the National Prayer Breakfast said something that was one of the most profound things I've ever heard from anybody at a gathering like that. He said, "The most violated commandment in Washington, DC"—everybody leaned in; do tell, Mr. President—"is, 'Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.'" I thought, "He's right. That is the most violated commandment in Washington." For me to go around saying that Barack Obama is a socialist is a violation of the Ninth Commandment. He is a liberal fellow. I'm conservative. We disagree...But I don't need to call him a socialist, and I hurt the country by doing so. The country has to come together to find a solution to these challenges or else we go over the cliff. **Mother Jones** [Confessions of a Tea Party Casualty](http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/08/bob-inglis-tea-party-casualty)
