Now seems like a good time to [pre-order the official biography of Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1451648537/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclos0a-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=1451648537) for your favourite Apple geek. Coming out on November 25th, 2011, it's being written by Walter Isaacson with the full consent of Jobs:

> Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.
