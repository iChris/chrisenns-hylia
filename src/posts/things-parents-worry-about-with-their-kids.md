From the NPR Health Blog, [5 Worries Parents Should Drop, and 5 They Shouldn't](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/08/30/129531631/5-worries-parents-should-drop-and-5-they-should):

> Thatâ€™s the sound of helicopter parents hovering over their children, worrying every second of the day that terrorists could strike Johnny's school or a stranger will snatch Jane from the bus stop.

Based on a survey, the top 5 worries of parents (presumably US based) are:

1.  Kidnapping
2.  School snipers
3.  Terrorists
4.  Dangerous strangers
5.  Drugs

And how do children actually get hurt/killed?

1.  Car accidents
2.  Homicide (usually committed by a person who knows the child, not a stranger)
3.  Abuse
4.  Suicide
5.  Drowning

So that either puts your mind at ease or gives you even more things to worry about that you hadn't thought of yet.
