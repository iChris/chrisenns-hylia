Today's the day for Apple's big announcement where everyone is expecting some sort of tablet/slate/canvas device. It's important to remember that despite what you may have heard, Apple has said **nothing** about this device to the press or anyone else. ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/top-300x203.jpg "Apple Invite") You can follow along at [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/live-from-the-apple-tablet-latest-creation-event/) site at 12pm (Sask. time anyway). To get caught up to speed on all the hoopla, I'd recommend reading [The Apple Tablet: A Complete History, Supposedly](http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/26/the-apple-tablet-a-complete-history-supposedly/) or [Macrumors Tablet Rumor Roundup](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/01/26/the-apple-tablet-rumor-roundup/).
