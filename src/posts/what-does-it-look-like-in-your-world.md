Just curious as I managed to get a glimpse of this page on my sis-in-law's new computer and noticed it looked all fubar'ed - at least in comparison to how I view it and think it looks. Does the site have two nicely laid out columns, the left one being the entries and the right one listing the archives, links, about me etc.. Or does it just go in one big long page that you have to scroll for, like, ever to get to the bottom of? Please comment.
