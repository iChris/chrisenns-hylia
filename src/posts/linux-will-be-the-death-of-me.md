Somehow in getting SSH to work, I've broken HTTP. Grrrr. Logically it's something I did but I've retraced my steps and as far as I know the only thing I've changed is the hosts.allow and hosts.deny files - which if I put them back to the way they were (as Carlos was helpful enough to do yesterday), locks me out of SSH again. I'm sure this is all very enlightening to the non-tech geeks out there. But you'll just have to suffer through it or go read another blog. :) It's a challenge that has been laid in front of me by Linux and I can't give in and admit defeat.
