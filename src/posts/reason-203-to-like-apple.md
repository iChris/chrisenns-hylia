Quote from Ken Segall, former creative director at TBWA\\Chiat\\Day, Apple's ad agency who worked on the _Think Different_ ads as well as came up with the name 'iMac':

> “Dell and Apple: It’s night and day,” Segall says. “It’s a transactional world Dell lives in. It’s all about numbers. Everything they say about Apple making products for themselves is true. Apple — it’s about changing the world. For everyone else, it’s about the money.”

For those of you who only know Apple as the successful company where everything it touches turns to piles of money, [this is a good read](http://www.cultofmac.com/20172/20172) on how Apple averted bankruptcy.
