Two-step verification is an important thing to enable on services like Gmail, Dropbox and more and more websites. Agilebits recently added the ability to use their app [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword), which many Mac users already use, to generate and store 2FA related passwords. TJ Luoma at MacStories [wrote a detailed tutorial on switching to 1Password](http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/switching-from-google-authenticator-or-authy-to-1password/):

> If you have been using Google Authenticator or Authy for two-step verification (“2FA” for short), you may have wondered whether you should switch to 1Password, now that it offers the same functionality. You may have wondered how much of a hassle it would be to change from one app to another, and if it would be worth it. If that describes you, well, then you’re in luck, because I just completed the switch and I’m here to report my results.

I'll be switching to 1Password going forward with 2FA passwords.
