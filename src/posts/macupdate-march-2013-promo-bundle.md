Time once again for the [MacUpdate bundle](http://deals.macupdate.com/affil/11916). 10 apps for $49. The main attraction for most people is getting Parallels Desktop 8 for $49 when it retails for $79 normally. Parallels allows you to install and run Windows (or Linux) operating systems on your Mac. Some of the other apps included in [the MacUpdate bundle](http://deals.macupdate.com/affil/11916) include:

*   **DEVONthink Pro 2**: Could be an interesting program to organize documents around a project.
*   **Prizmo 2**: Scanning and OCR'ing software which would probably work well with DEVONthink
*   **238 OpenType Fonts**: Who doesn't want more fonts?
*   **iStat Menus 4**: System monitoring application for your Mac. Most people probably could care less but nerds like details like this.
*   **PhotoStyler 6**: Instagram your photos.
*   **DiskAid 6**: Gives you file level access to all the data on your iOS device of choice.
