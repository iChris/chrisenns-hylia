Apple's new document called [App Store Review Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/appstore/guidelines.html) has, besides a lot of great new public guidelines for application developers, some wording that is very obviously written by a human - as opposed to a marketing/lawyer:

> We have over 250,000 apps in the App Store. We don’t need any more Fart apps.

> If your App looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you’re trying to get your first practice App into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don’t want their quality Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.

> We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I’ll know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.
