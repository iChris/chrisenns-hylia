When I talk to people about the Airplay, AppleTV and AirPort Express setup I use at our house ([see this post for more details](https://chrisenns.com/2011/11/airplay-with-apple-tv-and-airport-express/)), I often get asked about a set of speakers people have from an old stereo/amp and up until now you always had to have a big, clunky amplifier to hook up and power those speakers. I just saw [this post on TUAW.com](http://www.tuaw.com/2013/02/28/griffin-twenty-audio-amp-airplay-for-your-big-old-college-speak/) about Griffin's new Twenty Audio Amplifier that integrates with an Airport Express:

> Wouldn't it be nice if you could grab those humongous speakers that you bought back in college and somehow hook them up to an AirPlay-enabled amp? That's the idea behind the [Griffin Twenty Audio Amplifier](http://www.griffintechnology.com/twenty) (US$99.99), which uses your existing speakers and an old AirPort Express (not included) to let you stream music to your towers of power.
