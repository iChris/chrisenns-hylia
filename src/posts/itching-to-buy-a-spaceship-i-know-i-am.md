or today's crazy ebay auction we turn to the Russian space program - apparently someone has gotten their hands on a 1984 BOR-5 Space Shuttle Prototype (I personally prefered the '85 model with the power windows and locks, but that's just me). It can be yours for only $125,000US. Things are getting crazy between Pakistan and India. Nuclear weapon use is a possibility - very scary.
