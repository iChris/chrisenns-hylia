As seen on [512pixels.net](http://512pixels.net/2013/07/negroni-pixar/): a theory that all the films from Pixar fit into one world timeline. [Read it when you have a few minutes](http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/).

> Every movie is connected and implies major events that influence every single movie. Here we go. Brave is the first and last movie in the timeline. Obviously, this movie about a Scottish kingdom during the Dark Ages is the earliest time period covered by the Pixar films, but itâ€™s also the only Pixar movie that actually explains why animals in the Pixar universe behave like humans sometimes.

I love stuff like this. See also: [Leonardo Dicaprio movies](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/05/the-great-gatsby-is-an-alternate-timeline-where-jack-survived-titanic).
