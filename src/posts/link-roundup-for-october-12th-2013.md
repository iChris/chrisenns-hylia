Here's some stuff I saw this week that didn't make it into a full blog post:

*   [Google Sets Plan to Sell Users Endorsements](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/technology/google-sets-plan-to-sell-users-endorsements.html?_r=0): No surprise but disappointing all the same. At least [you can opt out](https://plus.google.com/settings/endorsements?hl=en) - for now.
*   [Facebook no longer lets users hide from search](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/facebook-no-longer-lets-users-hide-search): Related to the above - you are the product.
*   [Lorde performing her hit Royals on Q](http://youtu.be/nRVva2fk8BU)
*   [How to Disable the iCloud Open Dialog on Mountain Lion](http://chambersdaily.com/bradleychambers/2013/10/10/how-to-disable-the-icloud-open-dialog-on-mountain-lion): Comes in handy for anyone who's annoyed by this "feature" from Apple.
*   [Stream Pearl Jam's new album Lightning Bolt on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/lightning-bolt/id665391109?uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
