Gotta add a new entry just so i don't look like a warblogger - someone who just comments on the latest news from the WAR ON TERROR tm. It is interesting the more you read sites like www.whatreallyhappened.com it throws your mind for a loop trying to figure out who is really telling the truth. It's like an Enemy of The State/Consipracy Theory come to life moment. Only without the theme music and dramatic camera angles. In other news, the new songs that I worked on with Mark and Kirk should be going live any day now on our mp3.com site. One is a "Without Me" parody of Eminem's new single, and the other is a popped up remix of Mark's sequel to Mennonite Girl. Both are very fresh and spicy and deserve your full listening attention. Boo-yah!
