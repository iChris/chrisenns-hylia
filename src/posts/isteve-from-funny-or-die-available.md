[Available for streaming on Funny or Die is iSteve](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/d2e0f617e3/isteve), their movie about the life of Steve Jobs. I've only watched the first 8 minutes or so and I'm not sure if it's attempting to be funny and poke fun or a homage from fans - or some combination of the two. Bookmarked for viewing later.
