I was going to be traveling for a month and needed something that could do the work I normally do in my home office on my iMac:

*   Email
*   Invoicing and project tracking
*   Podcast recording and editing/production work for [clients](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/podcasting/)
*   WordPress updates for [clients](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/digital-marketing/)
