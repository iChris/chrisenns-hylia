Cedars, a school in Scotland, is profiled in one of [Apple's Education Profiles videos](http://www.apple.com/uk/education/resources/profiles.html#profiles-cedars) talking about the impact of a 1:1 iPad implementation for the students featuring [Fraser Speirs](http://fraserspeirs.com/). I first learned about Fraser years ago, back when iPhoto was introduced and shortly thereafter there became a need to export from iPhoto to a Flickr account. Fraser's [FlickrExport](http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/) was (and still is) the best Flickr export plugin for [iPhoto (MAS link)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fiphoto%252Fid408981381%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and now [Aperture (MAS link)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Faperture%252Fid408981426%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). He also writes on [his blog](http://speirs.org/) about his other life as an educator navigating the changing waters of education and technology.
