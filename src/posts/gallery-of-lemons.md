I've been half-heartedly trying out [Gallery](http://gallery.sourceforge.net/) for over a year now over on Sue's [family site](http://www.oatways.com) and thought I'd test my linux nerd-age by trying to install it on my [home machine](http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com). Wouldn't you know it, [it actually worked?](http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/) It's mainly because there's no MySQL required and PHP comes preinstalled on Mandrake (and most current Linux distros) so a monkey could do it really.
