Apple has their annual World Wide Developer's Conference this week, with the keynote happening this morning where they're expected to announce that they've cured cancer, developed a lunar colony, solved the mystery of how a Caramilk chocolate bar is made, new updated versions of their hardware and/or software to make Apple nerds drool and fork over their wallets. Oh, and maybe a TV interface of some sort that will revolutionize the way you and I watch TV. **Forever.** In honour of this event, there's a few Mac developers that have put their wares on sale. I'll try and update this post throughout the week if new ones come up that I feel are worth mentioning.
