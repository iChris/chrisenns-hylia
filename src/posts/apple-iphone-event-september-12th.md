Mark it on your calendar as [confirmed by Jim Dalrymple](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/07/30/apples-rumored-september-12-event/). Rumours of what's to be announced can be found at [imore.com](http://www.imore.com/apple-iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-event-planned-september-12-iphone-5-release-date-september-21), & [allthingsd.com](http://allthingsd.com/20120730/apple-stocks-up-on-components-for-fall-product-launch/) among others places, but the gist of it is:

*   New iPhone (the name will just be iPhone, just like the iPad)
*   iPad mini
*   iPod touch refresh
*   iPod nano refresh
*   Smaller dock connector

So if someone asks you if they should buy a iPhone 4/4S between now and September 12th, you can send them here and say to wait until September.
