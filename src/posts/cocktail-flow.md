Cocktail Flow ([iTunes App Store link (free)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcocktail-flow%252Fid486811622%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) is a drink recipe app[1](#fn-20054:1) that allows you to browse, find and discover cocktails. It's a beautifully designed app with plenty of nifty little animations and visual treats to go along with the recipes. \[gallery link="file"\] The up sell for them is by selling add-on theme packs of recipes. For example, they've got a Super Bowl theme pack with drinks named "The Bloody Halfback", "Safety Kick", and "Brady Bomb" - but there's plenty of free recipes included. A nice feature is the ability to specify what drinks you have in your cabinet (_i.e. Irish Whiskey, Scotch, White Rum, Amaretto and Irish Cream_[2](#fn-20054:2)) and then it can tell you what drinks you can make from that mix (_Amaretto Sour, Blow Job[3](#fn-20054:3) or a Godfather if you're curious._) Or choose the drinks you want to be able to make and it will spit out a shopping list, along with suggested costs. One minor gripe is that there's no ability to select Canadian currency as an option - though I suspect the USD is close enough for estimating your bill. All in all, a very good app particularly when you consider it's free.
