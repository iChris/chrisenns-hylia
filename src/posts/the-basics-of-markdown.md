I use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) style writing to keep notes on my computer and iPhone. It helps keep me sane in how I record show notes for [podcasts](http://ssktn.com) and when I'm writing draft posts for this blog and others. I keep meaning to record a screencast and write a blog post with details on how and why I use Markdown - but until that time I wanted to point people to [Ryan Irelan's](http://ryanirelan.com) [excellent screencast titled The Basics of Markdown](http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/basics-of-markdown/). For only $9 you will learn how to:

> Create portable, styled documents with Markdown, a simple-to-use markup language for web writing and more. In this 33 minute video, learn the syntax and the tools you can use to create beautiful Markdown documents.

Ryan's a really-smart-guyâ„¢ who's also a great teacher and when he's not helping keep the [cogs happy at Happy Cog](http://happycog.com/) he also publishes video training materials at [Mijingo](http://mijingo.com). I recently watched his free video on [using Soulver to create budgets](http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/budgets-with-soulver/) - [which is still on sale in the App Store I believe](https://chrisenns.com/2013/02/app-store-get-stuff-done-week-3-sale/) - and very quickly understood the app and could tell it'd be worth picking up.
