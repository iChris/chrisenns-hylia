Alec Baldwin interviewed David Simon, creator of The Wire, on the [most recent episode of Here's the Thing](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2013/jun/10/).

> The only caveat they had was we happen to notice you're not black. And your co-writer who is Ed Burns, the former police detective on The Corner, he's not black either. Can you get a black â€“ do you know any guys?

A great look at the mind behind one of the best series on television.
