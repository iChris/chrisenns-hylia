Check out this site for a live shot from a Boston area aquarium. I could watch for hours. Everybody to the limit. Annoy everyone around you with your speaker's cranked. Sit on this. Just what I need right now after a filling lunch at Alexander's. Mmmm... chicken fingers and fries with dipping sauce.... To go or not to go, that's not a quote from either of these plays: Mark recommends you go to Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan. He's seen Hamlet and loved it and we're planning on seeing the Alchemist sometime as well.
