Gabe from Penny Arcade [wrote about his realization that he's a bully](http://www.penny-arcade.com/2014/01/01/resolutions). His story of being bullied in his past, how he dealt with it then and how it affects the business of running Penny Arcade now is sad - but I'm hopeful that he's headed in the right direction. This line stuck out to me as a great quote for anyone struggling with their past and how they're letting it affect their present and future:

> I need to separate the busted kid from the man I am now.

I wonder if this digital internet world we live in enables people to not have to grow up in the same way people had to 20+ years ago.
