Commonly called freemium:

> a business model by which a product or service (typically a digital offering such as software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but a premium is charged for advanced features, functionality, or virtual goods. _[Wikipedia entry on freemium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium)_

From the [blog post at ADN HQ](http://blog.app.net/2013/02/25/introducing-a-free-tier/):

> Although App.net has had only paid account tiers thus far, we initially conceived of App.net as a freemium service. It took some time to get to this point, but we are now ready to make this vision a reality.

Free accounts are limited in the following ways:

*   Free tier accounts can follow a maximum of 40 users.
*   Free tier accounts have 500 MB of available file storage.
*   Free tier accounts can upload a file with a maximum size of 10 MB.

Here's a couple of invite codes to try out for yourself if you're interested. First come, first serve:

*   [App.net invite code 1](https://join.app.net/p/zzpgqlqctc)
*   [App.net invite code 2](https://join.app.net/p/vctcfwwfgk)
