MacHeist's NanoBundle for 2013 includes some great apps for $9.99:

*   [xScope](http://macheist.com/#xscope) is for developer/designers who need pixel measurements.
*   [iStopMotion](http://macheist.com/#istopmotion) is an app to record and create stop motion videos.
*   [Totals](http://macheist.com/#totals) I'm not familiar with but it's an invoicing app.
*   [Clarify](http://macheist.com/#clarify) is an app to more easily send screenshots and instructions.
*   [CLean My Mac](http://macheist.com/#cleanmymac2) does what it sounds like.

[Path Finder](http://macheist.com/#pathfinder) and [Little Inferno](http://macheist.com/#littleinferno) are unlocked once a certain number of sales have been reached - which they always do. [Fantastical](http://macheist.com/#fantastical) is the app that I'm most interested in picking up. I just don't do enough calendar/event scheduling that it makes it worth it to me. And the places I do a lot of scheduling for, namely [SSKTN](http://ssktn.com), I do it in Basecamp so Fantastical doesn't help there. Totalled up the apps would cost $250 if you bought them all. Just about all the apps included are more than $9.99 on their own so even if, like me, you're after just one it's still worth it to pick up the bundle. Will you be buying the 2013 MacHeist Bundle?
