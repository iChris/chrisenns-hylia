I realize most of us are pretty jaded and just assume technology should be able to do everything and anything because, well, it's technology. But this whole [FaceTime](http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/) thing is really incredible if you think about it. This is a screenshot from my iPhone making a video call (_FaceTime in Apple speak_) back to our iMac. [![The Future](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5102413679_101417a45b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/5102413679/ "The Future by iChris, on Flickr") The iPhone is a device that is [9.93mm (0.37 inch) thin](http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html) and you're able to make video calls on it. If that doesn't blow your mind think of where mobile/cell phone technology was 4 years ago before the iPhone came out. One of the most popular was a [Motorola Razr](http://www.google.ca/images?client=safari&rls=en&oe=UTF-8&redir_esc=&q=motorola+razr&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=aavATJKpFYegnQfpldT-CQ&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CEYQsAQwAw&biw=1288&bih=671). Give your head a shake and recognize how far we've come.

### Amazing.

Right now FaceTime is limited to wifi (aka internet) connections between iPhones, iPod touches or Mac computers since to try and do it over the cellular data networks would require a level of contract negotiations that even Apple couldn't pull off right now. But it's only a matter of time. (The iPhone isn't the only portable device to do this - it's just the first one that I've owned and that is this thin)
