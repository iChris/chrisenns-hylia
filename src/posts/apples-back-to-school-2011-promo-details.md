Kind of lame that it's dropped from being a free iPod touch (roughly $200CDN) to a $100 gift card for the iTunes Music/App Store or Mac App Store. Makes a lot of sense from Apple's perspective but I'm sure there will be a lot of disappointed folks who had waited until back to school time to buy their new Mac and iPod touch.  
  
In my former life as an employee at the University Computer Store it was always a popular promo that helped move a ton of Apple hardware.
