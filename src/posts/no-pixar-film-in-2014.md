Pixar has decided to delay The Good Dinosaur's release, their next film project, until 2015 meaning 2014 will be the first time in 8 years that there isn't a Pixar film in the theatres. [From Pixar Times:](http://pixartimes.com/2013/09/18/the-good-dinosaur-pushed-to-2015-no-pixar-film-in-2014/)

> Since 2006, it has been a given that we would see a Pixar film released during the summer season every year. The first indication that this streak was at risk of ending arrived with the news that The Good Dinosaur director [Bob Peterson had been taken off the project](http://pixartimes.com/2013/08/30/confirmed-the-good-dinosaur-switches-out-director-bob-peterson/). The film, which was scheduled to arrive in May 2014, was taken over by a collection of Pixar veterans such as John Lasseter and Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich, but no replacement director was named. For an animated film that was less than one year away, it signaled significant trouble.

Quality over quantity is a great thing to say when you're talking about small projects - but Pixar would generate hundreds of millions of dollars just putting out a film, period. Bumping The Good Dinosaur back a year means the Finding Nemo sequel [Finding Dory](http://pixartimes.com/category/news/finding-dory/) is now pushed into the summer of 2016. Hope somebody told [Ellen Degeneres](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JJmDavBXrw).
