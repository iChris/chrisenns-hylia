> "If you give something away to 500 million people, I suppose at least three people are always going to complain," he told the Diary.

There's an interesting tidbit at the end of the article:

> He (Jim Sheridan) is also in talks with American station HBO about making a small-screen version of his Oscar-nominated movie In America, telling the story of struggling Irish emigrants in New York.

In America ([Rent/buy on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/movie/in-america/id271061609?uo=4&at=10l4Ki)) is one of my favorite movies. My love for all things Irish notwithstanding, it's a beautiful film with a great cast including two real life sisters playing the little girls in the story. An HBO series based on the story would be great.
