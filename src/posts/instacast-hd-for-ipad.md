One of my favourite apps on the iPhone/iPod touch has just released it's iPad version - [Instacast HD](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstacast-hd%252Fid478853570%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and it looks great.

> Instacast HD is everything you love about Instacast, delivered in high definition on your iPad or iPad 2. Requiring iOS 5, it’s quite simply the best podcatcher available for iOS. Nothing compares to the astonishing interface, the simplicity, or the even the video experience Instacast HD is able to provide. It’s perfect for the couch, where you’re likely to be reading through your RSS feeds or watching your favorite Revision3 podcast. With the inclusion of iCloud sync to help keep played statuses and subscriptions in sync between your iOS devices, you really can have the best of both worlds.

Now to go borrow my wife's iPad to try it out. Instacast HD is available for $4.99 from the [App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstacast-hd%252Fid478853570%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
