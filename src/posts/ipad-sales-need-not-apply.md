John Gruber [wrote an interesting article](http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers) on how the NPD Group[1](#fn-19827:1) [goes out of their way](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111122b) to make the PC tablet industry sound like it's doing just fine - so long as you turn a blind eye to the pummeling the iPad is inflicting on the rest of the industry. The numbers are from January through to October, 2011.

So 3/4 of the people who didn't buy an iPad, didn't consider buying an iPad. Shocking, right? Using a fairly safe estimate of 10,000,000 iPads sold, John is able to guess that nearly 90% of tablet sales were iPads. So 10% of the tablets sold went to 5 other companies.[2](#fn-19827:2) Or as [Jason Snell tweeted](https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/139517109439959040):

> If I'm reading it right, it suggests 92% of tablet buyers considered iPad and 89% bought iPad. That's... not a good sign for competitors.

Time to figure out a way to buy some Apple stock.
