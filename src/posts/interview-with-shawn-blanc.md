One blogger I read [1](#fn-19902:1) is [Shawn Blanc and his blog shawnblanc.net](http://shawnblanc.net/). Around 10 months ago he took his blog full time by offering a [members option for $3/month](http://shawnblanc.net/members/) in addition to the [sponsorship options](http://shawnblanc.net/sponsors/). I had the opportunity to interview Shawn for my podcast, [Welcome to the Internet](http://ssktn.com/shows/welcome-to-the-internet/), and it just went live yesterday. [Listen to the interview](http://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/019-welcome-to-the-internet-shawn-blanc/). It's one of the shows I'm most proud thus far in my podcasting career and it's great to see it getting such a good response. Within 2 days, it's already become the second most downloaded episode on [SSKTN](http://ssktn.com) and has been listened to by people in lots of different countries than previous podcasts I've put out: ![Shawn Blanc Interview Download Countries](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/countrycoveragessktn.png "Shawn Blanc Interview Download Countries") Apparently Shawn is pretty popular in Poland.
