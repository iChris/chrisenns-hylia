Alec Baldwin, who's great as Jack Donaghy on [30 Rock](http://www.nbc.com/30-rock/), also has an excellent radio show/podcast where he interviews friends who also happen to be celebrities. The most recent one I listened to was [his interview with Lorne Micheals](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2012/jan/30/), producer of [Saturday Night Live](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/). In particular I really liked this quote from Lorne on how SNL works:

> We don't go on because we're ready. We go on because it's 11:30.

They may not always hit it out of the park, but when you start to think about the constraints they operate under it's incredible just to get an hour and a half long live show on the air at all. Also worth listening to is Alec's interview with [David Letterman](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2012/jun/18/).
