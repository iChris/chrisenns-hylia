I realized I haven't posted anything about it here but I've been doing a daily(ish) - heavy on the "ish" - podcast over at [pdcst.ca](http://www.pdcst.ca/). 10 minutes or less of me rambling about stuff on my brain. It's a bit of a relaunch of the original [Too Lazy to Blog podcast](http://www.ssktn.com/category/tltb/) I had going for awhile. It's mainly for my own curiosity and experiments in podcasting. As we continue to build [GoodStuff.fm](http://goodstuff.fm), I wanted to have a small space to mess around with podcasting. So that's where [pdcst.ca](http://www.pdcst.ca) comes in. You can start back [at episode 1](http://www.pdcst.ca/1/) and continue from there or subscribe [in iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/pdcst/id815675012) or via [RSS](http://www.pdcst.ca/feed/podcast/). If you're on ADN, you can [subscribe to the Broadcast channel](https://alpha.app.net/intent/subscribe/?channel_id=45359) and I also [tweet out new episodes with direct links to the MP3s](https://twitter.com/iChris).
