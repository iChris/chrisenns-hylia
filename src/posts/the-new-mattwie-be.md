Speaking of redesigns of blogs (and vanity urls to boot), Matt Wiebe - [guest number two on a little internet podcast thing](http://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/003-welcome-to-the-internet-matt-wiebe/) - recently launched his own redesigned blog:

> It’s all about the writing and not at all about anything else, like [my WordPress theme](http://somadesign.ca/projects/the-erudite/).

He seems to be missing the FaceSmashYourTwitter buttons to share the content, but I'm sure that's coming soon. (/sarcasm) [The New mattwie.be – mattwie.be](http://mattwie.be/2011/03/the-new-mattwie-be/).
