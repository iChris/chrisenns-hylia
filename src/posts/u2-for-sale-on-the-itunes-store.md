Likely due to their concerts in Montreal this weekend, much of U2's catalogue is on sale at iTunes. [$7.99 albums, $0.69 songs and $0.99 videos](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fartist%252Fu2%252Fid78500%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). Even if you've got most of their library in various forms, there's the remastered versions of [The Joshua Tree](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fthe-joshua-tree-remastered%252Fid267826054%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), [The Unforgettable Fire](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fthe-unforgettable-fire-remastered%252Fid336364089%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) , [Under a Blood Red Sky](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Funder-blood-red-sky-live-remastered%252Fid291734214%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), [October](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Foctober-remastered%252Fid285461110%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [War](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fwar-remastered%252Fid285461734%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) that will likely sound better than the versions you have now. I'd hold off on buying a copy of [Achtung Baby](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fachtung-baby%252Fid368713%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [Zooropa](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fzooropa%252Fid373513%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) since there's remastered/repackaged versions of those albums coming out this year.
