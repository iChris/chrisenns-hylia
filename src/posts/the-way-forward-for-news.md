[The Evening Edition](http://evening-edition.com/) is a news website published daily during the week at 5pm Pacific time. The site was developed by [Mule Design](http://muledesign.com/) who typically do client web work but as [this write up on ReadWriteWeb.com details](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/these-designers-did-for-fun-what-news-sites-cant-do-to-save-their-business.php), they're doing for fun what news sites can't do to save themselves.

> Evening Edition brings you today’s world news without push notifications. It has no streams or feeds. It doesn’t do \[BREAKING\] or \[UPDATING\]. It’s delivered by website to your device of choice every weekday at 5 p.m., and it’s just the right amount of reading for the subway ride from office to home.
