Check out [my review of the 2013 Ford Flex](http://www.mydadpodcasts.com/2012/10/reviewing-the-2013-ford-flex/) and while you're at it, kick the virtual tires on my new blog: [MyDadPodcasts.com](http://www.mydadpodcasts.com): [![MyDadPodcasts.com](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MyDadPodcasts.com_-600x376.png "MyDadPodcasts.com")](http://mydadpodcasts.com) I've wanted a place to write about stuff that's more family focused - particularly on life with kids and all the stuff besides technology that is going on - yet still written from the perspective of a guy who's into tech, the web and all sorts of other nerdy stuff. Reviews of products we like or get to try, a future podcast with my kids talking about their favourite things and maybe even a guest post or two from my wife if I can coax her into it. If it was still appropriate I'd put up a "Under Construction" animated GIF on the site but I prefer to just get the site launched as it is and refine it as I go. So while this site will remain the same Apple focused tech/nerd fest, [MyDadPodcasts.com](http://www.mydadpodcasts.com) will be more of a dad/family focused nerd fest. Of course there's the obligatory [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mydadpodcasts) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/My-Dad-Podcasts/366519010099846) pages as well if you want to follow/like those. Fairly barren for now but more to come.
