I don't know if this app will be around for very long as it's surprising that Apple allowed it to begin with plus it apparently copies [a good deal of marketing material from a jailbroken app, including the name](http://9to5mac.com/2012/06/18/previously-jailbreak-only-apple-allows-ios-display-recorder-app-into-app-store/). [Display Recorder is $1.99 in the App Store and apparently works on everything from the iPhone 3GS on up, the original iPad and 3rd generation iPod touch or later](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fdisplay-recorder%252Fid520411468%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
