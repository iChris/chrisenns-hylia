First, Yahoo [announced that they've reached an agreement to purchase Tumblr](http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an). Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo:

> We promise not to screw it up.

Yahoo has had a bit of a history with screwing up purchases like this - having purchased Geocities back in the day for around a billion dollars as well and then never doing anything with it until they killed it. And then Flickr, which Yahoo owns, [announced a redesign and new plans for the photo sharing service](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2013/05/20/a-better-brighter-flickr/) including a free terabyte of storage for every account:

> Weâ€™re giving your photos room to breathe, and you the space to upload a dizzying number of photos and videos, for free. Just how big is a terabyte? Well, you could take a photo every hour for forty years without filling one.

It's kind of like way back when [Google offered a free gigabyte with Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail) - 1 terabyte is so much space right now that it's hard to imagine ever needing it.
