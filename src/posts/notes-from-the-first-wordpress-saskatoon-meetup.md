I help organize a local user group for WordPress, the blogging platform used on this site and many others, and last night we had our initial meeting at [The Two Twenty](http://thetwotwenty.ca/). 8 other WordPress users and/or developers came out and we had a good time discussing plugins we use, backup procedures and also listening to Ryan Smith's talk on what he's used to help run and maintain [Ominocity](http://www.ominocity.com/2012/07/25/wordpress-saskatoon-lecture-slides/), a local website promoting the arts, music and independent media. For anyone interested, here are my notes from the meeting with links to relevant plugins/themes/etc.
