I don't normally post affiliate links/etc. here, but this is a really good one that you should check out if you're looking for a WordPress theme for your blog/website: [![WooThemes - WordPress themes for everyone](http://woothemes.com/ads/300x250a.jpg)](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=b38) They are offering 5 themes for the price of 1, plus 20% off the price of that one theme. It ends up costing you $56 (USD I believe) for 5 themes if you use coupon code "**BLACKPACKAGE**" at checkout. WooThemes is who I get most of my WordPress themes through and they do a quality job, not only on the design of the theme itself but also in how easy they make it to setup your website with a ton of options in the administration menu. Here's a screenshot from their [Canvas theme](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l64) that I often use as a starting point: [![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/canvasthemeoptions-300x246.jpg "Canvas Theme Options")](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/canvasthemeoptions.jpg) So go [check out their collection of themes](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l1) and upgrade your blog to a new look.
