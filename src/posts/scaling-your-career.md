I'd highly recommend watching [Marco Arment's talk](https://vimeo.com/55825725) from last year's [Çingleton conference](http://çingleton.com/en/) on scaling your career.

I can certainly identify times in my own career where I've been sitting around waiting for someone to hand me authority. And I can also remember times where I just stood up and took that authority, whether I really believed I was capable of doing it or not. I certainly regret the former and haven't ever regretted the later. Thanks to [Scott Morrison](https://twitter.com/smorr), owner of [Indev Software](http://www.indev.ca) and newly transplanted Saskatoon resident, for reminding me about the 2012 (and 2011) videos [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/cingleton). They've got great talks from really smart folks in the Apple community viewable for free if you're interested in that kind of thing.
