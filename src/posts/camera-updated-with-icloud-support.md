In addition to iOS6 and iPhone 5 support, they've added iCloud syncing of your light-table - so any photos you haven't saved out to the iOS Camera Roll will be synced across iCloud to other devices. They've also released an iPad version which looks great for editing photos on a bigger screen which when combined with iCloud support would make for a sweet mobile photography workflow. One person shooting photos on the iPhone 5 while an editor edits them on an iPad. Both versions of Camera+ are priced at $0.99 right now: [Camera+ for iPhone](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcamera%252B%252Fid329670577%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [Camera+ for iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcamera%252B-for-ipad%252Fid550902799%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
