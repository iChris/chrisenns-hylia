Want two hours of nerds geeking out over why Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace is such a bad film? The Incomparable has got you covered: Part 1 - [We Waited 16 Years For This?](http://5by5.tv/incomparable/136) and Part 2 - [Go Wash a Droid](http://5by5.tv/incomparable/137). Spoiler alert: McNulty was in The Phantom Menace? [Direct link](http://youtu.be/KqSGFaBI9PM) I can't even imagine the amount of editing Jason Snell had to do to put this 2 hour epic podcast together. Looking forward to chatting with him on [Show Me Your Mic](http://www.ssktn.com/category/smym/) in the future.
