> It's fitting, I suppose that a player who had stopped cursing would introduce f-bomb into common parlance. Someone who generally refrains from profanity is probably more likely to use such a profanity-avoiding phrase. And a converted non-swearer is also, perhaps, more likely to recognize the awesome power of that particular four-letter word, and thus to verbally grant it metaphorically explosive powers.

My favourite catcher growing up and the best player to ever wear a Expos uniform. _Via [Next Draft](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ed102783e87fee61c1a534a9d&id=82267f23b6&e=cd4a787825)_
