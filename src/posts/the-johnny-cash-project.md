[Beautiful tribute to the Man in Black](http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com/#/explore/TopRated):

> Working with a single image as a template, and using a custom drawing tool, you’ll create a unique and personal portrait of Johnny. Your work will then be combined with art from participants around the world, and integrated into a collective whole: a music video for "Ain’t No Grave", rising from a sea of one-of-a-kind portraits.
