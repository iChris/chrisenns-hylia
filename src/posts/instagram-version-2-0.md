Instagram, the popular iOS only photo taking/sharing app, just released version 2.0 of their application. Read [their blog post for all the details](http://blog.instagram.com/post/10444123475/v20). [Instagram is free in the App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstagram%252Fid389801252%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) if you're not already using it or hating it and not using it. You can see photos I've taken via Instagram posted to my Flickr page in the slideshow below to get an idea of what it does to photos.
