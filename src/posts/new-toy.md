This is the first toy we've bought Damien and he seems pretty excited about it!  Thanks to Heather's great searching skills we got it for only $20 off [Kijiji](http://saskatoon.kijiji.ca/).  I'm pretty happy about it too, since I was putting him in the bouncy chair all day long and I think he was getting sick of it.    ![](http://family.chrisenns.com/wp3/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/damiens-new-excersaucer-51.jpg)
