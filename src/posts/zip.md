Anyone out there tried/using [zip.ca](http://www.zip.ca)? It doesn't seem like that bad a deal. Basically commiting to paying $25/month for movie rentals - which I know most of us do that anyway with it being almost $6 each time at the local Blockbuster or whatever. Just curious if there's anyone with any actual experience with how well it works.
