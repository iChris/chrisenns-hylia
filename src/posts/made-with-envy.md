Let's say you're a consumer electronics company who's trying to compete with Apple at their own game - designing a high-end laptop with high quality parts that's as nice to look at as it is to use. Then let's say you want to produce a video highlighting the planning that went into designing the laptop, the time you spent iterating and making sure everything was just right. And let's say you added one key hardware difference that it the only thing people wouldn't say you outright copied from Apple in the design of your new laptop. In the video, wouldn't you make sure that when the volume dial you added to your laptop is shown that it wouldn't have a hardware defect on it that's visible to even the most casual observer? ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-18-at-8.38.43-AM.png "Hardware Envy") Envy indeed.
