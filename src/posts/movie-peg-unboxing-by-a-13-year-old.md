This is [kid is either me as a kid or one of my sons in the future](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/8826839). He's doing a 'live' un-boxing of a [Movie Peg](http://movie-peg.com/), a stand for an iPhone/iPad that looks like this: ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Moviepeg-Unboxing-300x222.jpg "Moviepeg Unboxing") Looks like a nice option. I still think [the Compass](http://twelvesouth.com/products/compass/) is the best stand going - but I haven't actually tried either of them yet. Why not get both?
