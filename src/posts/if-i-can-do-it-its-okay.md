I'm constantly amazed at how people justify things in the electronic world with the line that I can do it, so it's ok and how dare you even bring up the fact that I'm stealing:  _[Direct link to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0zt4opqL18&feature=player_embedded)_ I'm not going to stand on some high horse and say that I've never done it - but call a spade a spade. You're breaking the law. It doesn't matter if it's annoying/frustrating/easy to do/etc. You're breaking the law. Here's a few in case you're not aware:

*   Install software that you don't have a license for. _But I have a copy of Windows on my old machine that I sold to a friend and kept the CD so why I can't I just install it?? Waaaaah! I'm going to stick my fingers in my ears and put my head in the sand. I can't hear you! I can't hear you!_
*   Walk into 7-11, take an Oh Henry bar and put it in your pocket and leave without paying for it.

Acknowledge that what you're doing is wrong. Own up to it and make an attempt to do right the next time.
