I'm getting this error when I try to update my iPhone 4 to iOS5: ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-12-at-2.39.41-PM.png "The iPhone "iPhone" could not be restored. An internal error has occured.") Word on the internet is that it's because so many people are trying to update their iPhones that the validation servers at Apple aren't responding fast enough and the upgrade craps out. Keep trying? In the meantime, make sure your Mac OS X is up to date with the 10.7.2 update that came out today as well. **Update**: Looks like it got far enough to start the upgrade but then crapped out again. Now trying to wipe and restore. Advice - pull all your photos/videos into iPhoto before you upgrade just to be safe. Now seeing this: ![iTunes Has Detected an iPhone in Recovery Mode. You must restore this iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-12-at-3.43.38-PM.png "iTunes Has Detected an iPhone in Recovery Mode. You must restore this iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.") Followed by this: ![Are you sure you want to restore the iPhone "iPhone" to its factory settings? All of your media and other data will be erased, and the newest version of the iPhone software will be installed.](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-12-at-3.43.47-PM.png "Are you sure you want to restore the iPhone "iPhone" to its factory settings? All of your media and other data will be erased, and the newest version of the iPhone software will be installed.") And now it restarted back to the way it was before I started upgrading. Weird. **Update #2**: Back to the "The iPhone "iPhone" could not be restored. An internal error has occurred." loop. Going on 15+ attempts. **Update #3**: After about 20 tries, all of a sudden the iPhone did a complete wipe and restore from the previous backup (2 minutes earlier). When it came back to life it was running iOS5. Now it's in the process of adding my apps back, one by one.
