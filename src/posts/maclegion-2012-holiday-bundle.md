[10 Mac apps for $49.99](http://go2.maclegion.com/SH59). If you're a guitar player, getting [Capo alone makes it worthwhile](http://go2.maclegion.com/SH5B) as it normally sells for $49.99 - picking up [Fantastical](http://go2.maclegion.com/SH5D) and [TechTool Pro](http://go2.maclegion.com/SH5F) (normally $99) makes it a really great deal.
