Surprisingly the [interview is only 15 minutes and not 60 minutes](http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/conan-obriens-full-60-minutes-transcript/) as the show name implies.

> STEVE KROFT: Well, I think most people think you got screwed. I mean, Jay Leno thinks you got screwed. Jay Leno thinks he got screwed. CONAN O'BRIEN: How did he get screwed again? (LAUGHTER) Explain that part to me. I'm sorry. Jay's got The Tonight Show. I have a beard and an inflatable bat. And I'm touring city to city. Who can (LAUGHTER) say who won and who lost? I'm laughing 'cause crying would be sad.
