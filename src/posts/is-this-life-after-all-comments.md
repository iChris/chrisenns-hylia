If you like working with children, it's never too late for a B. Ed.

Ah I wouldn't say that I really like working with children.. it's just one thing that felt more rewarding than what I'm doing right now is all. I wasn't really the one in there working with them so much as helping get videos ready, taking pictures, setting up the music, etc. It's just that kids are a lot more forgiving than adults if something isn't quite right. :)
