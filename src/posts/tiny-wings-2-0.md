A great update to an already fun game, [only $0.99 in the App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftiny-wings%252Fid417817520%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). Perk of buying it on the App Store - version 2 included for free for anyone who had purchased version one.

There's also a new iPad version called Tiny Wings HD, [$2.99 in the App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftiny-wings-hd%252Fid541517597%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), that would look great on a new Retina iPad. But it's important to not over think these games. :) http://twitter.com/scottjacksonx/statuses/223719015967760385
