[LT](http://www.theheresy.com/) came over on Saturday night and gave me a hand with setting up my machine as a server. I still have to figure out how to get PHP support going as well as access remotely to my box (through a slick little add-in called [webmin](http://www.webmin.com/)) - then I'll try and get [MT](http://www.movabletype.org) running. But I did manage to get it running as web server. FTP is still not functional but I've managed to get a basic web page going. Nerd.
