This Sunday is the final game in the 2010 World Cup. The Netherlands, who beat Uruguay in the semi-final, will face off against Spain, who beat Germany (again - Spain beat Germany for the [European championships in 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008)). I've watched most of the games from the 2010 World Cup and while there have definitely been exciting moments, it's felt like the teams are playing it safe and there hasn't been a lot of the flash that I had expected from some of the world's best players.  _[Clip from 1998 World Cup game between the Netherlands and Argentina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlBHTyB1R0) via [Kottke.org](http://kottke.org/10/07/there-is-bergkamp)_ Part of my problem is that I'm a relative newbie when it comes to watching professional soccer/football. I've learned to appreciate the game a lot more than I used to 5 - 10 years ago but I still don't understand all the subtle nuances of what's actually happening on the pitch in the same way I do when watching a sport like hockey, basketball or volleyball. And I think that a big part of the reason for not understanding it is that aside from a couple years as a kid, I've never actually played soccer. It's something that I'd like to try sometime - maybe in time to make it on the Canadian World Cup team in 2014 in Brazil! **Prediction time**: Spain 2 - Netherlands 1.
