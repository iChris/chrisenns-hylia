I've added a few new things to the blog ([the mac blog](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/macblog/) makes a re-appearance) among which is a radio.blog music player. It's flash based and basically allows me to throw up a bunch of tunes I'm diggin and you can listen... or not. They're in flash format so it's not like you can go grab the MP3 and steal it. I'll be adding tracks to it shortly. _Idea swiped from [Caroline](http://www.prolific.org/). Thx!_
