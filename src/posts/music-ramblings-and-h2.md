I'm sure some of you vaguely remember me prattling on [way](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000083.html) back [when](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000082.html) about some band called Pilate that Carlos introduced me to and now that they're getting play on radio and Much you probably hate them because there's some magical rule about a band being played on radio and TV that forces you to hate them even if they write a good tune. Which is too bad because you'll miss out on a [great record](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CO14V/farawsoclos0a-20). After just finishing [Dude, Where's My Country](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446532231/farawsoclos0a-20) I'm wondering if Mr. Moore isn't behind [this site.](http://www.fuh2.com/)
