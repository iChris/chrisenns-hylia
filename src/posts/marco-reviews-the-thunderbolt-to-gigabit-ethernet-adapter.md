[Read the review for the details](http://www.marco.org/2012/07/02/thunderbolt-gigabit-adapter) but chances are you'll [want one for $29](http://store.apple.com/ca/product/MD463) if you transfer large files on a non-ethernet equipped Mac. I can't remember if I've ever used the [USB to Ethernet adapter](http://store.apple.com/ca/product/MC704ZM/A) I picked up when I bought my MacBook Air so I won't be rushing out to grab one. But if I was moving around more video files, it'd be the first thing I'd pick up.
