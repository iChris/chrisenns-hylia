Speaking of [Mike Monteiro](https://chrisenns.com/2011/04/07/mike-ftw-business-inspiration/), he's apparently got a show on 5by5.tv called "[Let's Make Mistakes](http://5by5.tv/mistakes)." ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mistakes-thumb.jpg "mistakes-thumb") It's hosted by Mike and Katie Gillum of [Mule Design](http://muledesign.com/) and they're two episodes in. [Fear of Public Speaking](http://5by5.tv/mistakes/1) and [Never Work for Free](http://5by5.tv/mistakes/2). Subscribed.
