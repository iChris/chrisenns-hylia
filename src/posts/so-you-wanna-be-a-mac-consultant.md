Patrick Rhone has a great [write up on what it takes to be a Mac consultant in 2013](http://patrickrhone.com/2013/04/14/so-you-wanna-be-a-mac-consultant-now/) - including his thoughts on how much to charge and how much patience you need (hint: a lot). His most important bit of advice is something applicable for anyone doing any sort of tech support:

> Also, be upfront about what you donâ€™t know but still be willing to help them get help.

A big part of the reason I couldn't stand working in tech support is there's always someone else out there willing to lie and give out an opinion as if it's fact. Nothing that a [left cross](https://chrisenns.com/g/leftcross.gif) wouldn't fix.
