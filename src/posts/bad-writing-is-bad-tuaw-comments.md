Chris, as you say, the post links to the NYT article. In fact, the very next sentence of the post is "According to a New York Times report, all of Time's magazines including People, Sports Illustrated, InStyle and Entertainment Weekly will be available soon in Apple's newsstand app." with a link to the NYT story. That said, you're right that the attribution should have been tighter. It's my goal to make it immediately clear to anyone reading our site when we're speaking from our own sourcing vs. someone else's interview or article, and we missed the mark on this one. The post will be edited to correct this. Thanks for your feedback. --Mike Rose, lead editor, TUAW

Thanks Mike. And like I said, I'm sure going through some of my 1,000+ posts on here would reveal some pretty poor writing. And thanks for stopping by and leaving a comment - really appreciate you taking the time to do that. Crap. I miss the days when I could write a snarky post on my blog and nobody would come read it. That's twice in a row I've had the "object" of my post come back and leave a comment. Haha. Chris

Ha! Always happy to engage with thoughtful and constructive critiques. It's a pretty big Internet, but as the saying goes, I wouldn't want to paint it.

Exactly. Looking in the mirror a bit, it's too bad I'm quick to write a negative post than a positive one. Overall I really do enjoy TUAW's writing and reporting. Many other Apple sites have long since been kicked to the RSS curb. Appreciate all the work you do over there. Chris.
