The interpreter disputed much of what Daisey has been saying on stage and on our show.

The attention that was focused on working conditions in Chinese factories was certainly a good thing. It's too bad that it came out of a fabricated story. To my knowledge Apple is still the only major company to put forth a [Supplier Responsibility statement](http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/) on what they are holding themselves and their suppliers accountable to. _Via [daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/16/schmitz-takedown)_
