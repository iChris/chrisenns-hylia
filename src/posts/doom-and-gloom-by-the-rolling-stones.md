> The Rolling Stones blend past and present on "Doom and Gloom," their first new song together in seven years. Mick Jagger sings about class tensions and oil fracking over a Keith Richards guitar riff with shades of Sticky Fingers, while Charlie Watts propels the whole thing with an unfussy, rock-solid beat.

A good Stones tune is needed for every generation. \[Direct link to video\] Available on the [iTunes Music Store as a Single](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fdoom-and-gloom-radio-edit%252Fid569699615%253Fi%253D569699770%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [as part of their new greatest hits collection, GRRR!, selling for $24.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fgrrr!-deluxe-version%252Fid569679465%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
