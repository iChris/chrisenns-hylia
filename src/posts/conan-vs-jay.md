It takes guts to walk away from any job over something that doesn't line up with your values and principles. When your job is a late night talk show seen by millions and worth millions of dollars and by leaving you are also putting a whole crew of people out of work, that takes some serious stones: [![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/conantweet-300x163.png "Conan Tweet")](http://twitter.com/johnmoe/statuses/7801296610) I'm sure Conan will end up on his feet somewhere. There's no way, if he actually wants to, that he won't have options elsewhere. And in light of [everything else going on in the world](https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/15/prayers-in-the-dark/), who really cares right? **See**: [here](http://tv.gawker.com/5448615/late-night-wars-jay-leno-turns-the-tables-and-bashes-conan-obrien-is-then-bashed-harder-by-jimmy-kimmel) and then [here](http://tv.gawker.com/5449596/late-night-war-enters-retaliatory-stage-as-leno-flips-the-table-on-letterman) if you, like us without TV, had no idea what was going on. **Update**: See why this is all so interesting: [Jay Leno's original announcement of Conan getting The Tonight Show in 2009](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/6d1caacad1/jay-s-2004-announcement)
