Kyle Roderick was kind enough to step in as guest host for a few Show Me Your Mic episodes. I enjoyed listening to my own show for the first time:

> This week, we have the guys over at The Dirt: Tim Wright, Mark Grambau, and Steve Hickey. The Dirt is a UX podcast that covers design, user experience, and their take on the latest tech news. We talk about the personality of a podcast and company, creating timeless content, and some really awesome virtual mixing.
