Via [Brett Terpstraâ€™s ReCap](http://brettterpstra.com/2014/04/09/recap-apr-9th-2014/) - this looks like a great app for creating presentation that's trying something different than your typical Powerpoint/Keynote style build:

> Concentrate on the content and simply write down your thoughts and Deckset turns them into awesome-looking slides.

Great looking [default themes](http://www.decksetapp.com/themes/) and writing/support for Markdown. Awesome. Deckset is [$19.99 in the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/deckset-turn-your-notes-into/id847496013?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)[](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/deckset-turn-your-notes-into/id847496013?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
