[![](http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2004/20040927l.jpg)](http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-09-27) The Sims 2 is out. No sign of a Mac version for some time yet which is probably a good thing. I despise the game on all levels, yet I know that if I got a copy I'd sit and play it for hours straight.
