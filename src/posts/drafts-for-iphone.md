Drafts for iOS ([Drafts for iPhone $2.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts%252Fid502385074%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), [Drafts for iPad $3.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts-for-ipad%252Fid542797283%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) is like most great apps that look so simple that's almost perplexing how you might use it but then you come across one little tip or trick and all of a sudden the app just opens up to you. \[caption id="attachment\_21307" align="aligncenter" width="200"\]![Blank screen in Drafts](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Drafts-for-iPhone01-200x300.jpg) Blank screen in Drafts\[/caption\] _Maybe that's just me?_ Reading through [Advanced Tips for Drafts App](http://georgecoghill.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/advanced-tips-for-drafts-app/) my brain hurts a bit trying to figure out how I might use Drafts. The idea of appending notes to a text file in Dropbox is awesome and confusing at the same time. So my simple use for Drafts right now is to post a tweet without having to actually log in to Twitter. Why would I want to do that? Well if I load up [Tweetbot](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftapbots%252Fid293642940%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) then I see the stream of tweets that I haven't read since I last looked, plus any replies or mentions I might have gotten as well. Not that I'm **so** popular that I have a lot of either, but it still pulls me in to keep up. Here's how it works with Drafts in a few screenshots. \[gallery ids="21307,21308,21309,21320"\] Here's that tweet: https://twitter.com/iChris/status/319215023375413248 Fancy hey?

I'm beginning to use it to send tasks and thoughts to Omnifocus, also to send entries to Day One but I often forget and just end up using the apps directly. Which is fine - except that on my iPhone 4 Drafts starts up much quicker than either of those two apps. Have you used Drafts yet? I'm curious how you've integrated it into your workflow.[](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fagile-tortoise%252Fid331942785%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)
