Well it seems jolly 'ole England was very good to Lindsay. As you can read below, he got himself engaged there. The lucky girl is Christine Jennings. So send your congratulations off to Linds. They're planning for a June 2003 wedding in England so start saving your pennies and watching for seat sales!
