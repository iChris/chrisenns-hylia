> Specifically, a $0.99 in-app purchase will let you play more than two games at the same time, it’ll unlock themes, and it’ll allow you to see played words during a game.

You'll need a friend to play with as it's multiplayer only. There's an auto-match feature in game to try and pair you with someone else.
