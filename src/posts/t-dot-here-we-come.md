Scott, [Phil](http://www.flipsaw.com/blog/) and I get to join up with our boss in Toronto this weekend for a conference with all the other campus retailers across Canada. We get into the T at midnight tonight and then get blasted by all the vendors trying to pitch us their wares in the form of pens, t-shirts and hats. Sunday we get more of the same and fly out, arriving back home around midnight. If I have internet access, I'll be dumping pics up on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/).
