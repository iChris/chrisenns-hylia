Using a bunch of geeky commands that go nerdier than I'm typically prepared to, [here's one way of setting up WordPress so it can handle a bunch of traffic](http://www.ewanleith.com/blog/900/10-million-hits-a-day-with-wordpress-using-a-15-server). WordPress, the CMS that powers this blog, gets a lot of flack for being unable to handle a large traffics spike. But that's typically because it's installed on a cheap server and isn't properly configured. At the very least install a cache plugin of some sort. I'm using [WP Super Cache](http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/) here but have been installing [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) on newer sites as it seems to be what more folks are using. Your average personal hobby website/blog probably doesn't need it - but if you ever do experience a bit of a traffic spike, you want to make sure all those people can get to your site rather than see a error page and never be able to read your words of wisdom. _Via [mondaybynoon.com](http://mondaybynoon.com/20120330/10-million-hits-a-day-with-wordpress-using-a-15-server/)_
