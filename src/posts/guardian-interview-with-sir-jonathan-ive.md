The quote you'll see [from the interview](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9438662/Apple-design-chief-Our-goal-isnt-to-make-money.html) will likely be this one:

> “Our goal isn’t to make money. Our goal absolutely at Apple is not to make money. This may sound a little flippant but it’s the truth,” said the British designer, who is credited with shaping the iPad and iPhone.

But I prefer this thought when he was talking about when Apple was nearly dead and Steve Jobs was brought back in to help revive the company:

> “You would have thought that, when what stands between you and bankruptcy is some money, your focus would be on making some money, but that was not \[Steve Jobs’\] preoccupation.
