Interesting looking Kickstarter project for something called [Coffee Joulies](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/705847536/coffee-joulies-your-coffee-just-right)

> Coffee Joulies work with your coffee to achieve two goals. First, they absorb extra thermal energy in your coffee when itâ€™s served too hot, cooling it down to a drinkable temperature three times faster than normal. Next, they release that stored energy back into your coffee keeping it in the right temperature range twice as long.

At $40 for a set of 5 Joulies, it's a bit too much for the amount of coffee I drink. But a coffee shop ordering a [box of 20 sets of 5 Coffee Joulies for $500](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/705847536/coffee-joulies-your-coffee-just-right/pledge/new?backing%5Bamount%5D=500.0&backing%5Bbacker_reward_id%5D=148383&clicked_reward=true&logged_in=false) would be a great way to set your shop apart from the competition. The hipsters would love it! _Via [ShawnBlanc.net](http://shawnblanc.net/2011/04/coffee-joulies/)_
