This will appeal to probably less than 1 percent of you, but my mind has been blown by these [Markdown Service Tools](http://brettterpstra.com/project/markdown-service-tools/) by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com). Particularly the 'Links from Safari Tabs'. That alone will save me a ton of time when working on [podcasts](http://ssktn.com). Found by listening to [episode 81 of Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu/81).
