[![Jasper](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-5-300x141.png "Jasper")](http://vimeo.com/5069046) Click the image above ([or click here](http://vimeo.com/5069046)) to watch a quick recap video of our recent trip out to Jasper for our anniversary. I'd embed it here but the HDs make it look much nicer. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out. I tried to make it different than your typical vacation video, while still conveying (at least to us) what the trip was about. Plus, huge mountains and cloudy vistas bring out the beauty of Sigur Rós.
