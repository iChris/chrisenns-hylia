Jane Caulfield of Metro Saskatoon interviewed me on Friday for a story on their website about [podcasting](http://www.ssktn.com) and [The YXE](http://yxe.ssktn.com) show I produce.

> Enns is a web developer in Saskatoon who describes himself as "passionate about podcasting" and has been producing podcasts for quite some time. He said the idea for The YXE came to him through conversations with other people in the city.

You can [read the story](http://metronews.ca/news/saskatoon/442804/local-podcast-looks-to-highlight-creative-innovative-people-in-saskatoon/) or you can [listen to Jane interview me on the most recent episode of The YXE](http://yxe.ssktn.com/jane-caufield-interviews-me/). I thought that since the story was about podcasting and The YXE podcast in particular, it was only fitting that we record it and publish it as a podcast.
