[Great takedown by Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2013/03/ceding_the_crown) of [this article posted to Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-apple-schiller-idUSBRE92C1FQ20130314):

> By market share alone, one can argue that Samsung is winning, but as I’ve stated above (and repeatedly recently), the iPhone has never been close to a market share leader. By market share alone, [the iPhone is far behind even Nokia](http://www.asymco.com/2012/11/14/google-vs-samsung/). The desire for the “Oh, how the mighty Apple has fallen” narrative is so strong that the narrative is simply being stated as fact, evidence to the contrary be damned. It’s reported as true simply because they want it to be true. They’re declaring “The King is dead; long live the King” not because the king has actually died or abdicated the throne, but because they’re bored with the king and want to write a new coronation story.
