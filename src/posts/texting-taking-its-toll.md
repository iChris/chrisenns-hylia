According to a recent [article in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/health/26teen.html?_r=1), texting is becoming a bit of an issue among teens. I, for one, am shocked. I had no idea that we as a society would unleash a new technology without having any sort of boundaries or training for it's potential users or thought given to it's impact until well after the fact.

> Texting may also be taking a toll on teenagersâ€™ thumbs. Annie Wagner, 15, a ninth-grade honor student in Bethesda, Md., used to text on her tiny LG phone as fast as she typed on a regular keyboard. A few months ago, she noticed a painful cramping in her thumbs. (Lately, she has been using the iPhone she got for her 15th birthday, and she says texting is slower and less painful.)

Ahh. Good to see that an Apple product once again saves the day. _Via [kottke.org](http://www.kottke.org/09/05/teens-texting-at-terrific-rate)_
