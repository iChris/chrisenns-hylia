Normally priced at $14.99, you can grab a [copy of Screeny for only zero dollars for today only](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fscreeny%252Fid440991524%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). Screeny is a Mac app for capturing what you're doing on your screen and sharing it with others. I use it for showing clients how to use the various applications I recommend to them for managing their website, but it's also great for when you're having an issue on your computer and want to show a friend who's helping you troubleshoot the problem. Just capture a video of it and send it off so they can see exactly what's going on. Here's a screen capture of how Screeny works, including cheesy stock background muzak: Free is free. Grab a copy even if you don't think you need it.
