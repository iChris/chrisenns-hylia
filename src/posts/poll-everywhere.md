[Poll Everywhere](http://www.polleverywhere.com/) looks like an interesting idea for schools or other presentation focused businesses or organizations. Plus it's got a sweet promo video produced by Adam Lisagor's [Sandwich Video](http://sandwichvideo.com/): [Direct link to video](https://vimeo.com/37674303) I really like that they include [the ability to embed a result live in a Keynote or Powerpoint presentation](http://www.polleverywhere.com/macpresenter) so that you don't have to switch out to a web page mid-presentation. Also, Canada is [included in their list of short code supported countries](http://www.polleverywhere.com/international). [Pricing](http://www.polleverywhere.com/plans) will either look crazy to you (_"What? Why would I pay a monthly fee to ask people something?"_) or be a tremendous value to you if you've ever had to pay for, setup and configure a polling system.
