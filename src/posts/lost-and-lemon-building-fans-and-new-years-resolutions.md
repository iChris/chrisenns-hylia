I'm really happy with how the most recent episode of the Lost & Lemon podcast I record with my brother-in-law turned out - [listen or download here](http://www.ssktn.com/podcasts/lostandlemon/043-lost-lemon-building-fans-and-new-years-resolutions/) / [subscribe in iTunes here](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=HGf4R7IezFs&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fpodcast%252F%252Fid467564174%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) - unplanned as usual but we found our way onto a topic that's been at the back of my brain for the last few weeks: this is the year that I either push [SSKTN](http://ssktn.com) up the hill to being a proper _thing_ or I pull back a bit and it just remains a little hobby. **SPOILER ALERT** Not to ruin the episode, but I want to grow SSKTN this year. Barring extenuating life circumstances, I want to be able to say in 10 - 12 months whether it can be a _thing_ I do. More to come.
