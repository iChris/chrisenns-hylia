As my son and I fall deeper into the Minecraft hole, we came across a great set of videos on YouTube by [paulsoaresjr](http://www.youtube.com/user/paulsoaresjr), particularly his [Survive and Thrive series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7326EF82122776A9) which gives a good overview of playing Minecraft. What's great about his videos is that they're family friendly. So many of the Minecraft videos we've tried to watch end up being a group of kids swearing at each other and making racist comments - it is the internet after all.

### Example Video

You can [click here to jump to the more interesting part of the video where he starts actually building his house](http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=SP7326EF82122776A9&feature=player_detailpage&v=AUYRnD7PzWI#t=456s), or watch the whole thing below.

### Money in Minecraft

As of this post, he's got almost 670,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel and that particular video has almost 900,000 plays. I don't know what rate he's on with YouTube but using videos I've uploaded as a rough guide, let's say YouTube pays out around $0.005 (half a penny) per view. A video with 900,000 plays would give him $4,500. Not bad for 20 minutes worth of video. But that's just one video in that particular series of 80, as of this posting, videos. One video in that series has [nearly 3.5 million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B36Ehzf2cxE&list=SP7326EF82122776A9&index=1) or approx. $17,500 using my very rough calculations. On average a video in the series ends up around 450,000 views - give or take. So 80 videos x 450,000 = 36,000,000 views x $0.005 = $180,000. Again, very rough and guestimatey math here.

### Can You Make a Living on YouTube with Minecraft Videos?

The first [video in the series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B36Ehzf2cxE&list=SP7326EF82122776A9&index=1) was posted, if the data is correct, sometime in January, 2012. So $180,000 over the last 19 months isn't bad work if you can get it. Except that's just that one series. His [Paul Plays Minecraft series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEbtIY4p_ltr9s1Yg3fUHZgQB_5T9fRp6) has 43 videos with an average of 240,000 views. Using the same numbers as above, that's another $51,000. He's got a whole ton of other videos - over 1,400 as of this post - and a lot of them have under 1,000 views. And I don't know what rate he's actually being paid by YouTube for the ads playing before his videos. Could be less than the $0.005 I'm guessing - but likely it's more.

### Awesome

It's interesting times when someone can make money showing others how to do stuff in a video game - but how much different is it than somebody trying to make money showing others how to [use apps on their Mac](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avu76lmur6s)? And Paul does an amazing job of keeping the videos entertaining for both me and my 6yr old son. Plus he gets to [play with his sons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQ7TOL8ScQ) which is all kinds of awesome.
