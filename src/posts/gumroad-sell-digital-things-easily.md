I came across [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) via a [tweet by Elliot Jay Stocks](https://twitter.com/elliotjaystocks/status/289326331672526848) and was intrigued by the service. It offers the ability to quickly and easily sell digital (and physical) things. So a song, an ebook, tutorial video, podcast, Photoshop template, WordPress theme, etc. anything that you can package up as a file Gumroad can sell for you as long as it's less than 4GB. For a quick test I listed a recently published (and [freely available](http://www.ssktn.com/podcasts/lostandlemon/041-lost-lemon-getting-fresh-with-freshbooks/) I might add so probably not worth actually buying unless you really want to support [SSKTN](http://ssktn.com)) episode of the [Lost & Lemon podcast](http://www.ssktn.com/shows/lostandlemon/) I do with my brother in law.

### Sample Listing

### Quick Review

I really like how quickly and easily I could list something for sale. Services like this that take all the friction out of selling a product are great because it enables anyone who's creative to put their _stuff_ out there without much effort - aside from all the effort of creating whatever it is. For me I could see using it to sell special one-off audio files (i.e. a tutorial or review), a training video or an ebook. There's other services out there that you could use - [Tinypass](http://www.tinypass.com) is another one I've come across recently - but [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) seems to be the quickest from signing up to listing your masterpiece that I've come across.
