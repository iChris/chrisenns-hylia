![U2 iPod](http://ccs.usask.ca/blog/archives/images/apple/u2ipod.jpg) So they announced a new U2 iPod. (You can catch the quicktime stream of the event [here](http://stream.apple.akadns.net/)) I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers, but I wouldn't go and spend an extra $110 above the cost of the regular 20GB iPod to get it either. I am, however, scheming up a way to get the new 60GB iPod Photo. That has potential to get some serious use. And with the S-Video/RCA output on it, I'm sure they'll be adding video out on it eventually. I don't care about watching it on the little 2" screen, but it'd be sweet to be able to take a movie I'm working on, dump it on the iPod and just take that to a meeting and show it on a TV or projector. Is there any mennogals out there that want to join [Jenn](http://www.mennoboy.com/jenjie/) as we set up a mennogal/mennoladies/something? Mennogirl.com is apparently taken? The cost goes down as more people join! :)
