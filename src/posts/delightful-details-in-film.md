From a [guest post by Josh Farmer on ShawnBlanc.net](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/unexpected-exceedings/):

> Downton Abbey uses shaky handheld cinematography when the subject is the servants, but steady and composed shots when the wealthy figures take screen time.

It's a detail that seems so obvious once you hear it, but obviously it's done subtle enough that they don't slap you in the face with it.
