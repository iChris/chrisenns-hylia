I've decided to give up Twitter for lent. Normally I'd just tweet stuff like this out but... I recorded an episode of Daily(ish) to explain it a bit, so if you're curious you can [listen here](http://goodstuff.fm/dailyish/75).

> Clarification on what I meant by giving up Twitter for Lent in yesterday's episode. And arguments about podcast listening speed.

As I said in the episode, I'd like to think that I'll [podcast more](http://goodstuff.fm/dailyish) and spend the time I would've spent on Twitter in deep, contemplative thought about life and what it all means - but I know it'll be just as easy to fill that void with other distractions if I'm not careful. Are you giving up anything for lent? Or maybe just stopping something for a period of time to evaluate what effect it has on you?
