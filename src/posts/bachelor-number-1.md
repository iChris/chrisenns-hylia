Sue's gone to the 'Peg to pick up her sisters and bro-in-law (also named Chris - the fun never stops at family get togethers) so I'll be partying it up this weekend, livin the single life again just like I used to before I got hitched up... ya know, ball and chain like. Which really means I'll be in bed by 10 on Friday after exhausting myself watching tv and trying to figure out whether a bag of smarties or a box of mini-wheats would make for a better meal. Party on! Woo!
