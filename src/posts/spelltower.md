[SpellTower for iPhone and iPad (currently $0.99 in the App Store)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fspelltower%252Fid476500832%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is a fun word game. I've played a couple of the levels of the Tower Mode and it's like combining Tetris with Boggle. There's what looks to be a great multiplayer component as well where you can drop the words you complete on your opponent while trying not to let your tower reach the top of the screen.
