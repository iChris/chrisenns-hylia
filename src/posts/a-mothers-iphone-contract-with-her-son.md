It happens to be for an iPhone but the rules all still apply if you don't have a "i" in front of your mobile device of choice. There's 18 points on the contract, all of which are great. I particularly like:

> 1.  It does not go to school with you. Have a conversation with the people you text in person. Itâ€™s a life skill. \*Half days, field trips and after school activities will require special consideration.
>     
> 2.  Turn it off, silence it, put it away in public. Especially in a restaurant, at the movies, or while speaking with another human being. You are not a rude person; do not allow the iPhone to change that.
>     
> 3.  You will mess up. I will take away your phone. We will sit down and talk about it. We will start over again. You & I, we are always learning. I am on your team. We are in this together.
>     

I don't know about you, but I see more grown adults having issues with their mobiles these days than kids. Common sense and basic rules of interactions are thrown out the window by people who otherwise should know better. \*The site is currently down so [here's a cached version of the page in case the link above doesn't work](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.janellburleyhofmann.com/gregorys-iphone-contract/). _Via [tuaw.com](http://www.tuaw.com/2012/12/31/mom-gives-son-iphone-with-18-point-contract/)_
