If what [Macrumors.com](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/11/23/apples-2011-black-friday-discounts-for-ipad-2-macbook-air-macbook-pro-imac-and-more/) is reporting is true, it looks like you will be able to get $100 off a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro or iMac this weekend. iPads & iPod touches will be $20 - $60 off. So now might be the time to buy yourself that early Christmas present.
