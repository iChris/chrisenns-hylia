Podcast Monday? Is that a thing? Maybe I'll make it a thing. At any rate. Here's some podcast episodes I've enjoyed recently that may do good things to your eardrums:

### Any Color But Purple, The New Disruptors

*   [Link](http://www.muleradio.net/newdisruptors/7/)

Glenn Fleishman, writer for [The Economist](http://www.economist.com) and executive editor of [The Magazine](http://www.economist.com) interviews [Jim Coudal](https://twitter.com/Coudal) of [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com/about.php) and have a great discussion about [The Deck Network](http://decknetwork.net/), an online advertising network, [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/) and in general the business of running a creative business in 2013. I'm tempted to just loop it in my office for the next while to let things soak in.

### John Gruber, The Big Web Show

Jeffrey Zeldman interviews John Gruber of [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) about how he got his start, why investors don't like Apple and where he got the name for his blog. As a long time reader of Daring Fireball and follower of [@gruber](http://twitter.com/gruber) on Twitter, I enjoyed the look behind the blog that Zeldman got out of Gruber in this podcast.

### A 'Full-Time' Masterclass with Shawn Blanc, CMD+SPACE

*   [Link](http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/1/23/026-a-full-time-masterclass-with-shawn-blanc.html)

Shawn Blanc, of [ShawnBlanc.net](http://shawnblanc.net/) and [my guest on Welcome to the Internet awhile back](http://www.ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/019-welcome-to-the-internet-shawn-blanc/), has a great chat with host Myke Hurley about taking a side business full-time and answering some great listener/reader questions along the way.

That's what's been in my ears lately. How about you?
