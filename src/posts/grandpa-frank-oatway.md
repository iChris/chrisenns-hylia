Sue's grandpa, Frank Oatway, passed away last week. A World War 2 veteran, an avid fan of curling and an even bigger fan of [Unity, Saskatchewan](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Unity,+Saskatchewan,+Canada&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=38.144864,79.716797&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Unity,+Division+No.+13,+Saskatchewan,+Canada&z=14), he will certainly be missed.
