[From Rainn Wilson's (Dwight from The Office) point of view.](http://rainn.posterous.com/red-carpet-from-my-pov) ![Paparazzi](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-21-300x221.png "Paparazzi") Quite terrifying that this is what people are wanting. There's enough demand for pictures/video of these folks that we need a good 20+ photographers taking pictures while someone walks down a carpet. _Via [Rainn's tweet](http://twitter.com/rainnwilson/status/1977129446)_
