Brought to you by The Office. On hearing that it's Tim's 30th birthday: **David Brent (the boss):** Things do change. It could be worse. There's a neighbour of mine, Calvin, he's 32 and he still lives with his parents. **Tim Canterbury:** I live with my parents. **David:** Cherish them... really. Because you'll miss them when they're not around. Both of mine are dead. **Tim:** Oh **David** Well, dad isn't... dead. He's in a home. So, as good as. ... **David:** Anyway... he is a vegetable now.. and that's something we all got to look forward to. Happy birthday.
