We would have some amazing photos from our two day retreat up north at Christopher Lake, but Sue decided it would be a good idea to leave the camera at home in case someone broke in to our place and wanted to leave us a picture of what they took. Or something like that. I'm feeling very disjointed right now. [The Store](http://ccs.usask.ca) has slowed down a bit, but one of my co-workers has left and so there's some extra work for everyone. A plus to it is that now I'm the 'official' Apple guy. Until we hire someone new, all it really means is that there's more work to go around - but hopefully once things settle down I'll be able to focus on work that I enjoy a little more. [HoW](http://houseofworship.blogspot.com/) band practice tonight and a [FGCC](http://www.forestgrovecc.com) practice tomorrow night and somehow I've got to come up with a concept/design for a video/slideshow for Sunday a.m. I love the stuff I get to do, I just wish I had more time for all of it.
