Finally broke down and picked up a copy of Settlers of Catan. Matt and Mark were nice enough to teach me how to play so I didn't have to bother with the instruction manual. To no one's surprise, Mark managed to win. :)  
  
Then we played it with my family after Thanksgiving supper and Sue took home the 'W'. After putting myself in a hole with my initial settlement placement, I went for the development card strategy and nearly pulled it out by buying 3 straight victory point cards.  
  
I think I just crossed a line to being even more nerdy than I was yesterday at this time. Awesome.
