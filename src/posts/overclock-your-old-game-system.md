I think it's time to pull out my old Sega Genesis... if I still have it some where... and play some Altered Beast, albeit with an [overclocked processor](http://www.epicgaming.net/hardware/md_oc) . I don't know what you could gain by overclocking your game system where the games are already tuned to run fine on it - but I guess it's not a question of why, more a question of why not? _Link from [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/11/0127235)_
