[Direct link to video](http://youtu.be/8ZXWdR7RzV8) [Cabel](http://cabel.me) is the founder of [Panic Software](http://panic.com), creator of great Mac apps like [Transmit](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/transmit/id403388562?mt=12) and [Coda](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/coda-2/id499340368?mt=12), and for his talk at XOXO 2013 he spoke about the process and toll of building a company and its products. The mental struggle you go through in trying to [build a business](http://lemonproductions.ca) and [a passion](http://ssktn.com) is something I wasn't completely prepared for - and still deal with almost every week. Intense highs and even more intense lows that leave you crippled and wondering how you can face your spouse or your kids. Like Cabel, I don't have an answer. I know for me the micro details are what bog me down and get my brain headed to darker places. When I'm able to take a step back and look at things at a macro level I can usually breath again. It's a bit like being on your knees, face down in a pool of water, running out of breath and not recognizing that you can just put your hands down to lift your head up to take a breath of fresh air. Talks like Cabel's help a lot. I'm far from alone in my efforts - but it helps to see others who have been through the fire and are still standing.
