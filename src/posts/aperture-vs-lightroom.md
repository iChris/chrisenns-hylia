Great comparison of the two main photo applications used by professionals and semi-professionals... and hacks like me. I currently use [Aperture (Mac App Store link)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Faperture%252Fid408981426%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), though I'm a version behind the most current one. [![Aperture - AppleÂ®](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-lrg.gif)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Faperture%252Fid408981426%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)
