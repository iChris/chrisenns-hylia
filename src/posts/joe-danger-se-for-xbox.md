I first posted about Joe Danger [back in January, 2010](https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/joe-danger/) and it's now finally coming out on [Xbox Live Arcade](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-GB/Product/Joe-Danger-Special-Edition/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802584111f5): [Direct link to video](http://youtu.be/csBHU12Gm14) My 4 year old son and I played through the demo last night and we were both having a great time with it. If you ever played [Excitebike back on NES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitebike), it's a great take on that style of gameplay only with modern graphics, fun audio and great animations and soundtrack.
