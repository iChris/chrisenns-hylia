I talked to someone at the Telus store in Midtown and they are now allowed to sell the iPhone 4 - they don't have any stock. Best Buy on 8th has (_had?_) just a single 16GB iPhone 4 in stock. I haven't phoned around anywhere else yet. I'm holding out for a 32GB version. With HD video recording and a decent camera I don't want to have to worry about running out of space. I **have** to have my N-Sync/Backstreet Boys/Spice Girls/New Kids on the Block collection with me at all times!
