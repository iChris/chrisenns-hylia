So I was bored last night and came up with this:  Do you ever watch screencasts/ video tutorials on software? What do you or don't you like about them? How did I do in explaining [Droplr](http://www.droplr.com)? _Link to video on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/8911507) or [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqWFpd6IIqk) if you prefer._ Video, high definition video in particular, on YouTube has really improved lately. I've generally steered clear of [YouTube](http://youtube.com/user/pbooker) for most of my video uploads in favour of [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/ichris76) but it certainly has gotten a lot better. I still prefer the clean look of how a video is displayed on Vimeo as opposed to the clutter of YouTube:

Vimeo:
