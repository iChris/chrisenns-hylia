A relaunch of a podcast I had \[previously published over at [SSKTN](http://www.ssktn.com/shows/too-lazy-to-blog/). I decided to use the name and rebrand it as a supplemental piece of content here on my blog. For now I'll just say it's a semi-regular podcast that I'll release when I feel like I have something to talk about. The podcasts I do over at [SSKTN](http://www.ssktn.com) I typically am involving another person - which is what I really prefer - but it makes it hard to schedule and hard to keep consistent. This will hopefully give me a way to keep pushing myself and honing my podcast related skills as well as test and play with audio related workflow. As always, I welcome your feedback.
