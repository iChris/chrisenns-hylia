Alright, last one I promise. Maybe. I've still got an Instapaper queue full of articles and memories on Steve to go through someday so I shouldn't really promise that. Apple has updated the [www.apple.com/stevejobs/](http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/) page to be a continually updating flow of memories and thanks that people have emailed in.
