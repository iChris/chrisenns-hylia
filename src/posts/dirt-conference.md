Looks like [this](http://www.dirtconference.com/) could be a good antidote for the [previous post](https://chrisenns.com/2009/10/07/becoming-willowback/), in a slightly ironic way. Hey, at least it's not an actual Willowback conference, right? [![Dirt Conference](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/dirtconference1.jpg "Dirt Conference")](http://www.dirtconference.com/) Also a great excuse to go further south as winter has arrived.
