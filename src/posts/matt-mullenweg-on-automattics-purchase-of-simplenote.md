[On the new Simplenote](http://ma.tt/2013/09/on-the-new-simplenote/):

> The beauty of Simplenote being under Automattic’s wing is that we are already blessed with incredibly fruitful businesses in WordPress.com, Akismet, and VaultPress. The biggest thing I didn’t like about the old app was the ads, and as you’ve noticed those are gone in this new version. Our main goal is to pour our heart into something and make it great, then it with the world. I find Simplenote indispensable, delightful, and use it every day, and I hope you will too.

I hope Matt finds more apps I like useful and indispensable and buys them, makes them free and remove the ads.
