An app that I [posted about](https://chrisenns.com/2012/10/foldingtext/) just over a week ago is now out of beta and in the Mac App Store - [FoldingText is available for $14.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ffoldingtext%252Fid540003654%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). It's currently at a 40% off launch sale[1](#fn-20872:1). ![FoldingText in the Mac App store](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FoldingText-in-the-Mac-App-store-600x371.png "FoldingText in the Mac App store") Like I said in my original post, it won't be for everyone but it could hit the sweet spot for a few in the note taking, to do list/GTD area. Even at it's sale price of $14.99 it's a bit too much for what I can currently see myself using it for.

1.  My math isn't good enough to figure out what 100% would be though I suspect it's somewhere near $32.99, give or take a dollar. [↩](#fnref-20872:1)
