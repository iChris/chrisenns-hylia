Real world friends and nearly neighbours, Rick & Jacqui, are headed down to [San Cristóbal de las Casas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Cristóbal_de_las_Casas) on a 3 year assignment with [Mennonite Central Committee](http://mcc.org/) to surf, lay on the beach and drink coronas - teach, train and help. Follow along on [their blog](http://randjblock.mennoboy.com/) and read about what they are **actually** going to be doing.
