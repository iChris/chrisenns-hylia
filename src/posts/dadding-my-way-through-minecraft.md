My son and I have been playing Minecraft on the Xbox 360 and I've been thinking that maybe there's other parents out there who's kids are asking them about Minecraft. So I did what any self-respecting internet nerd and guy who loves making screencasts would do - I started a [YouTube channel where I publish screencasts explaining Minecraft](http://www.youtube.com/ichrisplaysminecraft). As of this posting there's 5 episodes up, starting from the basics of [buying and installing Minecraft](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkh0M1MnJX8) to the most current episode where [I've started planting wheat and building a cow pen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7LPgAQPrwc). Really. If you're interested, hit the [subscribe button on the YouTube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/ichrisplaysminecraft) or check out the video playlist at the bottom of this post. I'd love to answer any questions about Minecraft that you might have so leave a comment below or on the [contact page](https://chrisenns.com/contact/) and I'll do my best to answer it in future episodes.

### Video

I feel like a bit of a dork that I'm (a) doing these videos and (b) talking about it publicly but I'm having lots of fun doing them and I know that at least four people have admitted to me that they've watched more than one of my videos so I'll continue. For now.
