Oh, one other thing I did forget to say. The tunes that I've been working on with Travis are finally up on our mp3.com site - so go and check 'em out and then come back here and leave some feedback. Don't bother with the last one as it's just an earlier version of that song that's much better in it's newer incarnation. Go on, we can take it. We're big boys now. Let me know what you love or hate about 'em.
