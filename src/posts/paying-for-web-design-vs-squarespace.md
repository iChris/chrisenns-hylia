Something about the way John Gruber & Marco Arment mocked paying money for web design during a Squarespace ad on The Talk Show seemed off. You can [listen here at the 1:14 mark](http://pca.st/yRf5). (**Edit**: I should add that the [rest of the episode](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/01/12/ep-107) is a great discussion of the struggles Apple is facing with keeping up software support on the Mac and iOS.) Iâ€™m not at all worried about my business or profession. It just sounded odd coming from two very creative people. People I generally respect. To hear your profession and business mocked so soundly hit a bit of a nerve I guess. Replace web design with iOS app design and would it be the same giggle? I realize neither John nor Marco make their money by developing iOS apps for clients. And I'm sure they're smart enough to recognize the value of having a professional involved in creating a website in some (most?) situations. Maybe the web design profession has gotten smeared with a similar brush as the SEO world where a bunch of bad apples who make a quick buck off uploading a theme to WordPress, copying and pasting in a bit of content, and then are never heard from again. For the record, I have no problem recommending [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/) to potential clients when it doesn't make sense for them to hire me. It's an amazing platform that's really powerful, really well designed and works great right out of the box. I just think you could do a better sponsor read that didn't involve mocking something. Talk about the benefits and positives of a product or service. But then what do I know from sponsor reads? I'm certainly not charging [$4k/episode for sponsorships](http://standard.fm).
