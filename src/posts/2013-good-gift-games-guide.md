Via a [tweet by @jasonsantamaria](https://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria/status/408624333020725248) comes an [interesting list of board game suggestions](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/the-2013-good-gift-games),[1](#fn-21785:1) most of which I'd never heard of. The two that jumped out at me are [Forbidden Desert](http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&page=game&show=277), sequel to [Forbidden Island](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65244/forbidden-island), and [Hanabi](http://www.rnrgames.com/Product.aspx?id=094923ac-56f1-47f2-8f52-2d8f097c61ac).

### Board Games on Your iPhone or iPad

A lot of board games make for great iOS games. The reviews on some of these look great - and for a fraction of the price of the full board game you can play and practice strategies on your iPad:

*   [Forbidden Island is $4.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/forbidden-island/id427419772?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
*   [Pandemic is $6.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/pandemic-the-board-game/id700793523?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
*   [Puerto Rico HD is $4.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/puerto-rico-hd/id438437326?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
*   [Lost Cities is $3.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/lost-cities/id465062454?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
*   [Ticket to Ride for iPad is $6.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ticket-to-ride/id432504470?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki), [Ticket to Ride Pocket for iPhone is $1.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ticket-to-ride-pocket/id471857988?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki), and [Ticket to Ride Europe Pocket is also $1.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ticket-to-ride-europe-pocket/id529454688?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki). It's a bit too small for my eyes on the iPhone but it'd be great on the iPad.
*   Worth mentioning: [Carcassonne for iPhone and iPad is on sale right now for $6.99](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/carcassonne/id375295479?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki). This is probably the game I've played the most on iOS.

What board games (iOS or regular) are you looking forward to playing over the holidays?
