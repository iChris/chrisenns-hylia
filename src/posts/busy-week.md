Got a busy week - at least on paper - ahead of me but it'll be good once it's over. I'm playing guitar and running a few videos in the two [Tenebrae](http://www.wethefc.com/tenebrae.html) services (one on Monday at 8pm and another on Friday at 7:30pm) and also playing guitar for the Easter musical performances on Sunday. But there's no Jr High Friday night and we also get Friday off from work so there's plenty more time to relax than usual. Pretty much everyone who's anyone has picked up a copy of Battlefield: Vietnam here at work so we're gonna have to get some multi-player hurtin going on pretty quick. So [Ryan](http://www.brainfuelmedia.com/postscript), if you were debating - now's the time to get in on the action. Staples has it for $39.95, cheapest in town!
