Version 1.40 of Dropbox has been released. [Photo uploading](http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=1165) is the big feature. It's a bit ironic that the service so many of us rely on for keeping things up to date doesn't have the ability to keep itself up to date - but that's the way it is. [Download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/install) or if you're not using Dropbox already, [go here to signup](http://db.tt/czHe7sK) and we'll both get a bit more space. I'm a paying Dropbox user, but who can't use more free space right?
