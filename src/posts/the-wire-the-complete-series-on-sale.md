The best show you'll never watch is [on sale for $149 (regularly $249) at Amazon.ca](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B001FA1P1W?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclos0a-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=B001FA1P1W) _Disclosure: Click that link and buy something and Amazon sends me a couple nickels._ It's got it's fair share of violence, swearing, etc. so it's definitely not for everyone. For a taste check out [Season 01 opening scene and title](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmIvu1yg3bU) and ['McNuggets'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvq3Pf3j61c). **Warning:** Salty language ahead. ![The Wire](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/thewire1.jpg "The Wire") From a reviewer on Amazon:

> THE WIRE has been called Dickensian, and there is truth to the comparison. This is a great American novel, highlighting the sad state of the inner city and the scarred souls who inhabit it.
