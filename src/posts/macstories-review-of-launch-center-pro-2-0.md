Version 2.0 of the popular workflow and action iOS app is out - [$4.99 in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) - and Federico has a [full review over at Macstories](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/launch-center-pro-2-0-review/):

> With today’s Launch Center Pro 2.0 for iPhone, a free update for existing customers, Contrast wants to ask: in the era of Drafts actions and Control Center, can Launch Center Pro still have a spot on a user’s Home screen, and possibly in the dock?

I've never picked up Launch Center Pro mainly because while I know there's a lot of power in using an app like that, it feels like I'd have to spend too much time **fiddling** and not enough time **doing** on my iPhone. I already have Drafts ([see my post on v3 of the app](https://chrisenns.com/2013/04/drafts-v3/)) that I already forget to use when it could save me taps, I don't know that I can justify another app that I'll forget to use. But if you like the idea of having shortcuts to commonly done tasks on your iPhone, it'd be worth taking a look at Launch Center Pro.[](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
