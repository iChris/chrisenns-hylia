A follow up to Will Smith's [previous appearance on the Graham Norton Show](https://chrisenns.com/2012/05/will-smith-raps-the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-intro/): [Direct link to video](http://youtu.be/zbZct9Ey-CI) It's funny that in 2013 they still have to pretend like they haven't completely planned this (_i.e. host saying "I don't want to put you on the spot.. you can tell me no."_) but still fun to watch. _Via [Neatorama.com](http://www.neatorama.com/2013/05/25/Will-Smith-on-the-Graham-Norton-Show-2/)_
