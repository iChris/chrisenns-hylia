Well my initial experience has been pretty good with allofmp3.com. I plopped $10US (approx $15Cdn) into Paypal and got 1GB of downloads from them. Being a bit nervous about how long it might actually last, I'm quickly burning through that 1GB. I've downloaded 5 complete albums (Nelly Furtado, Johnny Cash, Dido, Norah Jones, Daniel Lanois) as well as a bunch of other single tunes (call them guilty pleasures, \*cough\* Timberlake \*cough\*, stuff I wouldn't want to be caught buying at Future Shop - ). The more I read about them, they seem to be on the up and up. I found a [review of allofmp3.com](http://www.museekster.com/allofmp3info.htm) that explains a bit. They also link to a bunch of artists that [have free downloads on allofmp3.com.](http://www.museekster.com/allofmp3free.htm) Use your discretion. It boils down to laws being different in Russia (duh) as well as the US dollar to Russian ruble conversion being in our favor in a big way. It's no where near as easy as what iTunes music store would/will be - if [they](http://www.apple.com) ever get around to releasing it up north here.
