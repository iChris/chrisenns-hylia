Backblaze - [sign up here and support my blog](http://www.backblaze.com/partner/af2307) - does automatic, offsite back up from your computer. I use it and love having a backup system that I don't have to think about - much like Apple's own Time Machine service that's built into every Mac - plus it's offsite. Over on the Backblaze blog they've [written up details on their storage pod 4](http://blog.backblaze.com/2014/03/19/backblaze-storage-pod-4/) - the system of hard drives they build to back up all their customer's data:

> Storage Pod 4.0 uses forty-five 4 TB hard drives for a storage capacity of 180 TB

They've managed to get the cost per gigabyte down from $0.117 for their original Storage Pod in September, 2009 to $0.0517 currently on Storage Pod 4. You can [learn how to build your own](http://www.45drives.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) for around $10,500 or order it from [45drives](http://www.45drives.com/) for $12,600. We will never have enough storage.
