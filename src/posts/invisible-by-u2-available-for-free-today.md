Download [Invisible (RED) Edit Version](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/invisible-red-edit-version/id808571195?uo=4&at=10l4Ki). For every download, a US corporation donates a dollar to support [RED](http://www.red.org) in the fight against AIDS. As far as the song goes, I really dig the sound. Throwback to the 80s with a different vibe from your typical U2 tune of late. It's not going to be the lead single from their forthcoming album so it's not necessarily an indication of whatever direction they're headed but with Danger Mouse producing - or at least [producing most of the songs](http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/01/31/a-conversation-with-bono/5036165/).
