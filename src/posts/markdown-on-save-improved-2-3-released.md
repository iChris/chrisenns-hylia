[It](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/markdown-on-save-improved) went from being a "why would I ever use that?" to "I can't run a website without it" in the shortest time of any plugin I've used on WordPress.

> The plugin hadn’t been updated in an embarrassingly long time, but I finally got around to fixing some bugs around mobile publishing and updating the included Markdown Extra library to the latest version. It won’t go without updates so long again.

Markdown on Save Improved (or MOSI as I prefer to call it when I never say it out loud) is developed by [Matt Wiebe](http://wp.mattwie.be/2013/01/19/markdown-on-save-improved-2-3-released/).
