And not in a good way. [Movabletype](http://www.movabletype.org/) launched the developer's edition of MT3 which gives us a peek at what's in store for the regular joe blow version coming later. (Acutally they've put out their [personal license options now](http://secure.sixapart.com/)) Basically if you have more than one or author and/or more than 3 weblogs on a single site, [you have to pay.](http://secure.sixapart.com/) The Personal Edition will regularly be $99.95US and gives you up to 3 authors and up to 5 weblogs. On mennoboy we've officially got 4 blogs with 4 authors. That means I'd really have to look at getting the Personal Edition Volume License 1 for the bargin price of $149.95US. Ouch. Not to mention the 8 authors and 4 blogs we have on [Sue's family site.](http://www.oatways.com) [There's a lot of unhappy folks in the blogosphere.](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/33072#670011) I'm really not sure what to do for [the site I'm supposed to be redesigining.](http://www.forestgrovecc.com) I have nothing personally against [LT's system](http://www.theheresy.com/), but it only half works on most Mac browsers and I can't help people use something I can't see. I'm really hoping the outcry will convince [SixApart](http://www.sixapart.com/) (the company that makes MT) to open up the requirements and limitations on their licensing.
