Steve Jobs drove a silver Mercedes SL55 AMG just like everyone else, except it never had a license plate on it. I assumed, like most, that he just paid the fine for not having your plate affixed to your vehicle for the sake of being different. [The truth is even better](http://www.itwire.com/it-people-news/enterprise/50649-the-truth-about-steve-jobs-number-plate):

> Steve (or someone close to him) spotted a loophole in the California vehicle laws. Anyone with a brand new car had a maximum of six months to affix the issued number plate to the vehicle.
