I'm still working on some of my thoughts on the WWDC 2011 keynote, but this is a great take on Apple's announcements from someone in the trenches of education - a classroom in Scotland to be precise.  
  
I agree with his main premise - AirPlay mirroring is a bigger deal than Apple made it out to be in the keynote. Once people wrap their heads around this one, Apple will sell a ton of AppleTVs and iPads.
