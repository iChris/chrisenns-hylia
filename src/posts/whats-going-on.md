Just in case you're wondering why all these old entries are showing up - thanks to the [internet archive](http://web.archive.org) I can go and grab a bunch of my old entries. It's actually a neat way to remember what you're site once looked like if you're into frequent redesigns like I am. Since I'm nerdy about being complete I'll be trying to grab as much of my old entries as possible. I didn't realize I had started this version of the blog back in May of 2002. Coming up on 2 years now. That's a lot of blabbing.
