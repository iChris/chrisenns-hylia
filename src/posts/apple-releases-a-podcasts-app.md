![Podcasts app for iOS 5](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Podcasts-app-for-iOS-5.png "Podcasts app for iOS 5") Looks interesting. Not a huge surprise as apparently podcasts were removed from the Music app in iOS 6. Though according to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/donmcallister/status/217676236078579713), RSS support is non-existent which means it's only good for podcasts listed in the iTunes Podcast directory. Shouldn't be a problem since all a podcast has to do is submit their RSS feed to Apple for inclusion - but some podcasts may not be in there for a variety of reasons. https://twitter.com/donmcallister/status/217676236078579713 [Download it for free from the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8)
