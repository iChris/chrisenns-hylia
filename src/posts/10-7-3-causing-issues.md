If [yesterday's update](https://chrisenns.com/2012/02/lion-10-7-3-update-released/) is causing you issues - [weird CUI errors that crash apps](http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/2/2766036/mac-os-x-10-7-3-update-sever-app-crashes) - then [downloading the combo update](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1484) might be what's needed before you start running to your backups, [according to this post on TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/02/os-x-10-7-3-causing-cui-errors-for-some-combo-update-recommende/). The combo updater is the full 10.7.3 fix, including all minor upgrades/patches released between 10.7.2 and 10.7.3. The update that you download from Software Update is a delta update - which only includes the most recent changes that your computer doesn't already have.
