I don't think it's better than [this site's melt your face intro](https://chrisenns.com/2009/03/11/best-church-website-evar/), but [ICCM](http://www.iccm-1.org/) comes pretty close. It's sites like these that are what the web was made for. If your organization's website isn't this loud and in your face, pack up and go home because you're just not trying hard enough.
