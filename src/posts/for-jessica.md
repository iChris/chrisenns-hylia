If you are a parent and can make it through [this article](http://jenniferlawler.com/wordpress/?p=747) without choking up, I don't think I really want to know you and your robotic ways:

> But they didn’t tell you ahead of time, and by the time you figured out that being her mother was going to make your life look like a nuclear bomb had detonated in the middle of it, it was too late, because she’s your daughter and you loved her even before she was born, so you’re a little biased and you can’t always see her clearly, and what you see is a high-spirited, ebullient girl with a stubborn streak, and other people see a slow-moving, cognitively-impaired kid who can’t be budged once she makes up her mind.

I, for one, can't wait to get home and hug my boys.
