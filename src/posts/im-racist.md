Walking through the tunnel with two coffees in my hand a East Indian girl from one of the tables setup there came up to me and asked me "Are you against racism?" I naturally responded: "No." Ooops. I was thinking she was going to offer me a chance to sign up for the National Day To Support Hamster Rights or something. So "No" just popped out of my mouth before I thought anything else. Heh heh. So now I'm a racist on campus.
