Kirk's 'Without Me' parody has been climbing the charts - well the mp3.com parody charts anyways. Saturday he was at number 12 and Sunday he hit number 6. It sounds impressive, but it's actually only taken 15 and 16 qualified plays (the way mp3.com rates your song) to get to that spot and the song has been ranked 7976 and 5529 in overall performance on mp3.com. So only 5529 more to go to number one!
