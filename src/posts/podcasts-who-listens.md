According to [this article from the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9545533.stm), more people listen to podcasts than use Twitter. Podcasting's greatest strength is also what hinders it from being a sexy buzzword that you'd hear about on the news:

> What podcasting still offers is a chance for anyone to get behind a microphone and, for all intents and purposes, make a radio programme. But even for the biggest in the business, it takes a little time for it to get going.

I'm still trying to figure out my way with podcasting over at [SSKTN](http://www.ssktn.com/) - but I still really believe in it as a medium for fostering community, discussion and support in the digital age. ![SSKTN Podcasting](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ssktn-screenshot-600x285.png "SSKTN Podcasting")
