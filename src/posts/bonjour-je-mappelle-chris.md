We watched 'Amelie' last night and enjoyed it a lot. (M&H you'll love the french - Heidi could probably even watch it without subtitles by now I bet!) A very cute, funny movie. I was really impressed with the whole look of the film - the camera angles, the over-saturated colors - very well done. Some of the extras on the DVD were interesting, some were boring and some we didn't watch. Two thumbs up from this household. We're off to the lake so don't expect much in the way of updates. Watch Mark's site for possibly more updates - or possibly not. l8r.
