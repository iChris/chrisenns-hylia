My sister, Andrea, had a baby girl yesterday morning: [![BeerBaby Giving the Middle Finger](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2790/4109325179_b1547044b4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/4109325179/ "BeerBaby Giving the Middle Finger") As of yet, she goes un-named. For now, we only know her as 'BeerBaby.' Because her parent's last name is Beer. What were you thinking?
