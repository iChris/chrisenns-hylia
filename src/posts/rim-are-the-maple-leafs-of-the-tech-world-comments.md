The Leafs aren't doing that bad. They're more like the Phoenix Coyotes - they're already on life support, the only people that go to their games are fans of other teams, and nobody takes them seriously. Everyone know's they're moving to another city, but it just hasn't happened yet.

I stand by my comparison if only because the Leafs are from Ontario.
