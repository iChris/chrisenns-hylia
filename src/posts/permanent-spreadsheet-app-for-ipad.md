I saw this [via Loren Brichter on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lorenb/status/306837063192412160). Billed as "The new era of touch spreadsheets. Starting on iPad.", [Permanent (App Store link, currently 50% for launch at $9.99)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpermanent-new-spreadsheet%252Fid602402480%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) looks like an interesting app to pick up if you're doing a lot of spreadsheeting. Spreadsheets? Number crunching on your iPad.
