For me, 10.3 was the first usable version of OSX. I started with 10.1 but couldn't get hooked on it. At that time I far preferred XP to 10.1 and 10.2 for speed and ease of use. So I slummed it on some no name grey laptop with a white apple sticker placed strategically on the cover. 10.3 was released when I bought an eMac (probably from you, Chris) and used it to do more than just video editing. It was so smooth and it looked so great. When 10.4 was released I never looked back. Spotlight was the clincher. There was no question for me we were going all Mac at home and I was thankful when we did the same at my work. And there is no question that when a new version is released, I will upgrade. After waiting a few days to see if there's any early adopter problems, of course! What was your first daily usable version of OSX? And your favourite version jump?

I don't remember which one I thought of as usable. I just remember iMovie blowing my mind so whenever that first started shipping? The most recent versions (Lion, MoLo) have been exciting as they figure out how to navigate a touch influenced world while hanging on to an old style interface. It's got to be tempting to throw a whole bunch of touch/iOS style stuff back in the Mac but having the restraint to do it where appropriate will determine how successful OS X remains to be.
