Jon Krakauer [gives an update on where Greg Mortenson, author of Three Cups of Tea, is these days](https://medium.com/@jonkrakauer/greg-mortenson-disgraced-author-of-three-cups-of-tea-believes-he-will-have-the-last-laugh-760949b1f964) after being revealed to be a fraud and abuser of donations to his charity. Turns out, quite well actually:

> Turning a blind eye to his dishonest words and deeds, the CAI board of directors has continued to pitch Mortenson as the organization’s moral exemplar and guiding light, and still pays him $176,000 per year, according to the latest financial records released by CAI.

Incredibly, Mortenson has attempted to build actual bridges to try and help connect his lies:

> And here’s the kicker: It was Mortenson who personally arranged for this bridge to be built and paid for with CAI funds, according to Zaman Ali, a resident of Askole who helped build it.

Unreal.

> When our heroes turn out to be sleazebags, self-deception is easier than facing the facts.
