I finally got it working. It came down to some permissions. I may have opened myself up to attacks from the hax0r world but I don't care - [I got a blogger blog working!](http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com) Once I get PHP and Perl working I can get Movabletype going and start serving up some blogs and dump dixiesys where mennoboy currently is hosted. 20GB of storage sounds a lot better than 200MB, doncha think?
