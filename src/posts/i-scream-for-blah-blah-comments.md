Is the new Battlefield Vietnam game worth getting?

You have to have the full BF1942 game to play it as it's an expansion. I'll have to get back to you - a guy at work ordered it but it hasn't arrived yet. One cool thing is in the huey's (choppers) that they fly apparently you can turn on the radio and people can hear the radio playing as you fly overhead. :)

Correction - it's not an expansion pack, it's a stand alone version.
