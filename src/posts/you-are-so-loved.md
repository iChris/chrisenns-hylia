> “[When you are dying, you need to be told how loved you are](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/you-are-so-loved-lawyer-describes-efforts-to-save-nathan-cirillo/article21274458/).”

Yesterday an honour guard solider was [killed in my country's capital city, Ottawa](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/what-unfolded-during-the-attack-in-ottawa/article21229398/). The soldier's name was Nathan Cirillo. The name of the coward who shot him in the back while guarding [The National War Memorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_War_Memorial_(Canada)) is not worth repeating. The coward was later [killed by the sergeant-at-arms](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/sergeant-at-arms-who-reportedly-shot-suspect-hailed-as-hero-by-mps/article21237164/). It's so senseless and random. I don't understand how someone can make the choice to end another human being's life.
