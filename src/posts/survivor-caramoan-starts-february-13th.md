My wife and I remain fans of the reality TV show Survivor [1](#fn-21123:1) and with the next season of the show they're returning to the fans versus favourites formula in [Survivor: Caramoan](http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/photos/1000079/survivor-caramoan-cast/33836). Love it or hate it, this will be the 26th season of a television show that many picked to be gone awhile ago. If you're more of a Survivor fan than I am, you could start watching anyone of the many other Survivor spinoffs from around the world as [listed on the Survivor Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(TV_series)).

1.  That and The Amazing Race are the only two reality shows we regularly watch. [↩](#fnref-21123:1)
