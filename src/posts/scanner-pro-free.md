Scanner Pro, an iOS app that allows you to "scan" paper into your iPhone or iPad, is [currently free in the iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) - down from it's regular price of $7.

> Scanner Pro transforms your iPhone and iPad into portable scanners. It allows you to scan receipts, whiteboards, paper notes, or any multipage document. Scanned documents can be emailed and printed, uploaded to Dropbox, Google Drive and Evernote, or simply saved on the iPhone/iPad. The application incorporates special algorithms that remove shadows, make scans sharper, correct perspective and make them as readable as possible.

I already use Evernote for this type of collection of documents and receipts so I'll have to see how Scanner Pro might fit into my workflow. I suspect the main use will be combining multi-page documents into a single document.
