The recording industry is not being hurt by pirated music as they would like you to believe. [Here's an excellent write-up](http://arstechnica.com/news/posts/1080605291.html) on the recent news that's come out that the Australian recording industry is hiding numbers showing that they've had their best year ever so that they can trumpet the anti-piracy claims. And a [new study](http://news.com.com/2100-1027_3-5181562.html) by researchers at Harvard and N. Carolina states that _even high levels of file-swapping seemed to translate into an effect on album sales that was "statistically indistinguishable from zero."_
