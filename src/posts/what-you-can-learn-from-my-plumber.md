From my new favourite website, [Put Things Off](http://putthingsoff.com).

> My plumber has an excellent business card. It says "Phil Jones" on the top line. Underneath that is his job title: "Plumber". It's great because it tells me everything I need to know about what he does. He doesn't try to dress up his line of work by calling himself a "Strategic Pipeline Analyst" or an "Aqueous Substance Manager". He does what it says on the tin. Your job title should do the same.

The above quote is from an article entitled "[The Job Title Blacklist for the Self-Employed](http://putthingsoff.com/articles/job-title-blacklist/)" but it could really apply to anyone in any size of business. Does your job title accurately reflect what it is you do?
