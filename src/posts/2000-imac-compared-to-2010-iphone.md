An interesting comparison from [this post in the Arstechnica.com forum](http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1114049): Year: **2000** Model: **iMac** Operating System - Mac OS 9.0.4 Processor - 500 MHz PowerPC G3 CPU, 128MB Memory Graphics - ATI Rage 128 Pro, 8MB of memory (8 million triangles) Screen - 786K pixels Data Transfer Speeds - 1.3-12.5 MB/s (DVD-ROM-1/100 Ethernet) Storage - 30GB Hard Drive **Dimensions - 15.0 x 15.0 x 17.1 inches** **Weight - 34.7 pounds** Year: **2010** Model: **iPhone 4** Operating System - iOS 4.0 Processor - 1 Ghz ARM A4 CPU, 512MB Memory Graphics - PowerVR SGX 535, uses system memory (28 million triangles) Screen - 614K pixels Data Transfer Speeds - .04-20MB/s (3G-WiFi) Storage - 32GB Flash Drive **Dimensions - 4.5 x 2.31 x .31 inches** **Weight - 4.8 ounces** Numbers/stats are neat, but one crazy thing to think about is that the iPhone 4 can [record and edit HD (720p) video](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/hd-video-recording.html) - which you would never be able to do on that desktop iMac.
