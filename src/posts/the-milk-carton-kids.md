Live From Lincoln Theatre (Full DVD Stream): http://youtu.be/gL8eBrhVTJ4 [Direct link to video](http://youtu.be/gL8eBrhVTJ4) Found this band [via Marco Arment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/490321351631056896). You may enjoy them as well if you like folksy songs with a touch of acoustic guitar magic. Their first two albums are supposed to be available for free on [their website](http://www.themilkcartonkids.com) but perhaps because of the Marco Arment tweet, their [Dropbox](http://db.tt/czHe7sK) account is suspended due to too many downloads. Their 3rd album, the Grammy nominated Ash & Clay, [is available on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-ash-clay/id586847819?uo=4&at=10l4Ki).[](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/the-milk-carton-kids/id447349428?uo=4&at=10l4Ki)
