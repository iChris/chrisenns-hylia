The trailer for Wes Anderson's next film, Moonrise Kingdom, [is out](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/moonrisekingdom/). Comes to theatres in May, 2012. ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Moonrise-Kingdom.png "Moonrise Kingdom") I wasn't sure about it until Bill Murray's last line. Interestingly, the way I found out about it was because a letterer & designer I follow [tweeted that she did the titles for the film](https://twitter.com/jessicahische/status/157557230449852416).
