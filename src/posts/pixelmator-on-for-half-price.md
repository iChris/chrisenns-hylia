Since turkeys gave their life for Americans this weekend, [Pixelmator is on sale for half off in the Mac App Store for only $14.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fpixelmator%252Fid407963104%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). I keep meaning to do a screencast showing why Pixelmator is so great as a Photoshop alternative for 75% of what people typically use Photoshop for - so until I do that you'll just have to take my word for it that Pixelmator is a great deal at it's regular $29.99 so at $14.99 it's a steal. For anyone with a Retina Mac it's also Retina ready with their recent update:

> Both Pixelmatorâ€™s friendly user interface and its powerful image editing engine are now optimized for the new MacBook Pro with Retina display.
