For a limited time you can get Brett Kelly's excellent (and recently updated) book Evernote Essentials for half off - only $14.99 [in the iBooks Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/evernote-essentials/id709838195?mt=11&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) or [in other formats directly from Brett](https://members.nerdgap.com/evernote-essentials/buy/). I'm still on the fence on how much I want to use [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com), but if you're at all into using Evernote this is a recommended book to pick up and learn more about a great app.
