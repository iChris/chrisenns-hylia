![On the Bog walk](http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/lemon/Waskesiu/Waskesiu_Aug_04_14.sized.jpg) We went up to my parent's shack at Waskesiu this weekend - ([pics available here if you're interested](http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/Waskesiu)) and now we're getting ready to leave for North Carolina. It's supposed to be 25 - 35 degrees down there this week so we'll hopefully get at least one full week of summer this year.
