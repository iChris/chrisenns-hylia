Apple's running a "everything is at least 50% off" promotion for photo and video apps for both iOS and the Mac App Store. I'm not a big user of iOS apps for photography beyond the usual suspects - Apple's Camera and Photos app, Instagram and Flickr occasionally - the better deals are on the Mac apps:

*   [Pixelmator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) is a great Photoshop alternative at a fraction of the price.
*   [Flare 2](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/flare-2/id924691732?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) and [Analog](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/analog/id418343177?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) are kind of like Instagram filters for your Mac.
*   [ScreenFlow 5](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/screenflow-5/id917790450?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) is the best deal. A great app for editing video. It's designed primarily for recording your Mac's display to demo software but it works great as a video editor if [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/imovie/id408981434?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki) isn't your cup of tea.
