U2's Achtung Baby has been covered from start to finish. Originally released in the UK with the December issue of Q magazine, the album features artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Damien Rice, Patti Smith, Garbage, Snow Patrol, Gavin Friday, The Killers and Jack White each taking a track from U2's 1991 album. It's [selling for $7.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fid478064554%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and $6.93 of each album sold will be donated to [Concern](http://www.concern.net/). Jack White covering 'Love is Blindness' is probably the standout track for me. Damien Rice doing 'One' is also great, as is Snow Patrol's slowdown of 'Mysterious Ways'.
