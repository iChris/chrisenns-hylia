It's not confirmed by Apple yet, but [rumour has it that Regina will be getting Saskatchewan's first Apple store](http://www.macrumors.com/2012/05/01/upcoming-saskatchewan-apple-retail-store-fills-huge-void-in-coverage/). I don't know if things have changed since I worked in retail, but back then Apple had little to no support presence in Saskatchewan - sales and tech support was based out of Winnipeg or Alberta. It sucks that they chose Regina though. Saskatoon would make a much better spot for an Apple store, but then I'm a little biased. **Update** Looks like, if [@himpster / @jackleCBC](https://twitter.com/himpster/status/197382468586848257) are right, that it's just an Apple reseller not an official Apple store.
