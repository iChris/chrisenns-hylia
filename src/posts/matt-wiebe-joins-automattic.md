Congrats to Winnipeg based web nerd Matt Wiebe on the news that [he's joining Automattic](http://somadesign.ca/2012/goodbye-soma-hello-automattic/), the company behind [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), as a Theme Engineer. Winnipeg is fast becoming a northern hub for [Automat­ti­cians](http://automattic.com/work-with-us/), with Matt joining [Ian Stewart](http://iandanielstewart.com/) and [Krista Stevens](http://kristastevens.com/) on staff at Automattic. Congrats Matt. I look forward to reading more of your [crotchety theme descriptions](http://somadesign.ca/projects/the-erudite/).
