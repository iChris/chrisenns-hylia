> Do Not Disturb scheduling feature will resume normal functionality after January 7, 2013. Before this date, you should manually turn the Do Not Disturb feature on or off.

Bad bug that shouldn't have been too hard to test. Especially bad timing since Apple just started [advertising the feature](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLJN_d2sVjk).
