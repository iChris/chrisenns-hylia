I use Instacast on my iPhone to listen to podcasts ([Instacast 3 in the App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Finstacast-3%252Fid577056377%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) and as nice as it is to have podcasts on the go, I spend a good portion of my day at my laptop playing a podcast on my iPhone which sits on my desk. Not a big deal but it does use my iPhone's battery while playing and so I often end up having my iPhone plugged in and charging. Or as [Stephen Hackett put it](http://512pixels.net/2013/05/instacast-mac-beta/):

> Finally, our long national nightmare of listening to our iPhones at our desks is coming to an end.

The Instacast for Mac beta is [now available to try out](http://vemedio.com/products/instacast-mac) and I'm excited to give it a spin.

\[gallery ids="21377,21378,21379,21380,21381"\] I've been hanging on to Instacast 2 on my iPhone but it looks like I might finally have to take the plunge and upgrade to get Instacast Cloud support for syncing of playlists and podcasts between the Mac and iOS.
