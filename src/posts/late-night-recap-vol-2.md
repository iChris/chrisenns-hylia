More recaps from the whole Leno vs Conan debacle [here](http://tv.gawker.com/5452391/as-obrien-laughs-in-the-face-of-nbc-and-lenos-attacks-once-again-turn-personal-letterman-unleashes-vintage-jay). Summary: Letterman is having a blast with this. Conan is at his best when he's the underdog. And Jay just seems as slimy as you'd think an LA talk show host would be. See [the previous post for more fun (or petty?) stuff.](https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/16/conan-vs-jay/)
