... and still no iTunes Music store available to Canada. Very nice promo for Apple on Survivor tonight. They used a Powerbook with an iSight to connect the 'survivor's to their loved ones back home. The video quality looked a little too good to be true since they were connecting via satellite - and it turned out to be so as they had their loved ones hidden on the island. So maybe it was just a good advertisement for Airport wireless and the iSight. Either way, it looked cool for Apple. I've tried the iSight and it works as good as advertised.
