Welcome to episode 5. It's a special cross-over episode with my [Lost & Lemon](http://www.ssktn.com/shows/lostandlemon/) co-host Chris Huebert. We talk about Chris working out, listening to my parenting podcast, setting up aliases with Gmail, iMessage issues, review the new iPad and talk about the TV series Revolution. As always, I welcome your feedback in the comments below.
