Might as well download it today rather than get caught up with everyone else downloading it tomorrow when [iCloud is launched](http://www.apple.com/icloud/). Use [this link](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) to download it directly or just hit up Software Update under the Apple (top left corner of your Mac). ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Software-Update.png "Software Update")
