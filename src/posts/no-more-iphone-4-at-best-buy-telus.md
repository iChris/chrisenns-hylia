According to [JR in the comments of the previous post](https://chrisenns.com/2010/08/23/farmer-harvs-iphone-is-on-sasktel/#comments):

> An update: I spoke with a Best Buy associate this evening, and it turns out they no longer have the iPhone 4 in stock; they have been recalled. No one seems to know why, or when they’ll be back. I don’t care who gets the iPhone, be it Telus or Sasktel, I just want to know when I can get one!

Very frustrating. And I'm sure the associates at Best Buy are equally frustrated. Rogers can't get any iPhones to sell and Telus can't figure out how to sell the ones they have. Meanwhile, Sasktel is still [negotiating to secure the iPhone](http://twitter.com/SaskTel/status/21937252297). [Cue theme music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8vINCq_IAI).
