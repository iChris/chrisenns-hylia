 I hope this is a real commercial. I applaud you Robert Lee and [Cullman Liquidation](http://cullmanliquidation.com/) for your honesty. If I was buying a mobile home, I'd definitely buy one from you. _[Link to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-RLqLx1iYI) / via [@cameronmoll](http://twitter.com/cameronmoll/status/5073412821)_
