If the [nerds are starting to switch from Google to Bing](http://gizmodo.com/5875571/google-just-made-bing-the-best-search-engine), you know things are getting bad:

> Google changed the way search works this week. It deeply integrated Google+ into search results. It's ostensibly meant to deliver more personalized results. But it pulls those personalized results largely from Google servicesâ€”Google+, Picasa, YouTube. Search for a restaurant, and instead of its Yelp page, the top result might be someone you know discussing it on Google Plus.

Can't say I'm all that concerned yet. But it is interesting to see Google getting thrown into the same corner as Microsoft used to be a few years ago - the big, bad monster that's out to get you and every company.
