No, not actual flights provided by Google. Rather their search utility for finding flights is [now available for Canadian cities](http://www.google.ca/flights). ![Google Flights for Canada](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Google-Flights-for-Canada-600x404.png "Google Flights for Canada") I prefer the look and feel of [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com/) but it can't hurt to have the king of search trying to find good flights.
