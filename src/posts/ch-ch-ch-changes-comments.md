Something in me doesn't like a washburn - maybe it's just the name... I dunno. I might have to take a trip down to Regina. Or to Avenue Guitars in Edmonton... they've got a nice collection as well.

I'm thinking anything with midi support is not going to make it past the first round - I'd guess that Toni Iommi doesn't even know how to spell midi.

meh, there will be enough other stuff on that beauty to get it noticed. midi's actually more popular with bassists than guitarists.
