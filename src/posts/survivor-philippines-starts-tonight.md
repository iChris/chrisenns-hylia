I can't stand most reality TV shows but Survivor and The Amazing Race are the two that my wife and I enjoy watching. [1](#fn-20758:1) I don't like it when they bring on celebrities because it starts to feel like a ratings grab - except that typically the celebrities they bring on are huge fans of Survivor and want to be on the show as badly as anyone else. This edition's famous players include a former Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player, [Jeff Kent](http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/159999/), and [Lisa Whelchel](http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/160003/) who was an actress on the 80s TV show [Facts of Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078610/). The ironic thing is that most of the other contestants are probably too young to even know or care who a 80s TV star is anyway.

1.  Yes I know you watched the first season and haven't watched it since. And yet you're still an expert on how bad a show it is. Tell me more about things you know so much about yet haven't actually watched or experienced in 10 years, I love it. [↩](#fnref-20758:1)
