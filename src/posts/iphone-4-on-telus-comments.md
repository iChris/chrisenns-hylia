I don't know what to do. I need a new phone, asap (no contract, battery is fried, all I have is a car-charger, flip hinges are starting to go). But, the only phone I want is an iPhone. I would rather go with Sasktel, but if they don't have anything to offer, I don't really have another choice. I'll have to look into the plans telus will offer) I might have to make my decision soon though, seeing as Telus' iPhones will probably disappear by the end of Monday.
