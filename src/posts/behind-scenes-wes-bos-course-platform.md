I'm a sucker for behind the scenes of almost anything except how hot dogs are made. Wes Bos [puts out awesome training courses](http://wesbos.com/courses/) for really nerdy web stuff that even I don't understand most of. And of course for someone who knows as much as he does about web dev/code magic, he doesn't just use an existing app to run the store to sell/giveaway his courses.
