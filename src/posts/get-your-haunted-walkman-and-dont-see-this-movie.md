So Sue and I saw Changing Lanes last night (after a very tasty meal at Earl's). I don't really recommend it. Ben Affleck isn't that great of an actor and the movie just leaves you feeling (blech). There isn't really an antagonist or a protagonist and so when the movie ends, you just feel like nothing's happened. On a lighter note, check out this auction for a haunted walkman and be sure to scroll down and take in the photo of the walkman in use. (I'm pretty sure it's all a joke.... at least I hope so)
