Some very nice building blocks for kids (and for their parents?): ![Baroque](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/04-08-02-041.jpg "Baroque") [Architectural building blocks](http://inquisitivekid.com/catalog/architectural_blocks.aspx) ![Marble Run](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/06-07-09-021.jpg "Marble Run") Also some neat [marble run kits](http://inquisitivekid.com/catalog/basic_runs.aspx). I think Damien might want these for his birthday. :) _Via [swiss-miss.com](http://www.swiss-miss.com/2009/04/pluunk-furniture.html)_
