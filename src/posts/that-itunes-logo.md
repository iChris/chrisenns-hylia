There's a lot of [criticism from design nerds](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/09/03/steve-jobs-defends-new-itunes-10-icon-against-criticism/) over Apple's new icon for [iTunes 10](http://www.apple.com/itunes/): ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/itunes10logo.jpg "iTunes 10 Logo") While flipping through the Walmart flyer this weekend, I noticed this: ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/walmartspecial.jpg "Walmart Special Icon") Maybe Apple just wanted to remind people of the great deals on the iTunes store by associating with Walmart? [Here's one possible replacement icon](http://www.ryanrjames.com/itunes/) you can use if you're feeling like the current one just isn't matching your mojo. [Here's another one](http://dribbble.com/shots/52197-vinylTunes-2-0) that goes for more of a retro/vinyl feel.
