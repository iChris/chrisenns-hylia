I decided to go with the comment registration route in order to minimize my headaches with comment spam. I don't know why the spammers pick on some sites and leave others alone, but my site used to get at least 4-6 comment-spams a day. Basically if you register yourself and log in, you can comment as much as you like. If you don't register, you can't comment. Simple and easy. The other mennoboy blog sites are set up this way by default right now, but it's up to each of them as to whether they keep it that way or not. It may seem like a hassle, but it's the way it's gotta be. That's why [blogger](http://www.blogger.com) is doing the same thing.
