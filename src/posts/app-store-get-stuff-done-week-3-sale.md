This time it's a category of Apps called "Utilize" and features more great apps to help you be a bit more productive. Or at least spend more time on the idea of being productive. Here's the apps I'd recommend or am familiar with that are 50% off:

*   [1Password (on sale for $24.99)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F1password-password-manager%252Fid443987910%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) Use **something** besides 'password123' for your passwords. Something so simple as your email account password can unlock everything you do online.
*   [Fantastical (on sale for $9.99)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ffantastical%252Fid435003921%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) is a great menu bar replacement for the built in Calendar app on OS X. The great thing about how your data is stored on OS X is that you can use multiple apps and they all access the same central data.
*   [PopClip (on sale for $2.99)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpopclip%252Fid445189367%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) gives you iOS style pop-over links to copy/paste. I had tried the beta and really liked the idea - I suspect Apple will eventually build something like this into OS X.
*   [Soulver (on sale for $12.99)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsoulver%252Fid413965349%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) - a calculator app that functions like a piece of paper with a built in calculator. I'm not as tempted by the Mac App as I am by the [iPhone ($2.99 in the App Store)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsoulver-notepad-calculator%252Fid348142037%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) or [iPad ($4.99 in the App Store)](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsoulver-for-ipad%252Fid371982536%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) versions, but could be good to have in on your Mac if you do a lot of calculations there.
