I hadn't read or heard much about Rogue One and just assumed, because of [Star Wars: Clone Wars](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Clone_Wars) and [Star Wars: Rebels](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels) that Rogue One would also be a cartoon series. So I was really pumped to find out that (a) it's live action, and (b) it's a full blown movie set in the Star Wars universe.

> ...the film will revolve around a rogue band of resistance fighters who unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans and bring new hope to the galaxy.

Can't wait for December 16th, 2016.
