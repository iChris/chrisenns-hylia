> Space Age is a game of cosmic adventure. Set in the retro-futuristic sci-fi world of 1976, it follows a small but determined band of intergalactic explorers who land on a seemingly uninhabited planet, Kepler-16. They soon discover there’s something both strange and familiar about this alien place…

This is one of the few times I get to actually say "I've been testing this for a few weeks now and it's great" because somehow I managed to get an invite on to the Space Age beta and play through it a bit - up until I upgraded my phone and was no longer a novelty user running an iPhone 4 AND partially colour blind. Plus it's set in the year I was born. So there's that. I only played through the first two levels but can definitely say it's a blast to play. The storyline of the game is fun to get into and the nostalgic 90s style game play is lots of fun. [Neven Mrgan](https://twitter.com/mrgan) and [Matt Comi](https://twitter.com/mattcomi), the developers of the game under the company name Big Bucket Software, do such a great job of mining nostalgic elements while still keeping the game modern with gameplay elements, flow, style and user interface. If you like this style of game, you should check out their previous game, The Incident ([iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id385533456?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki), [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id408679233?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)). Pick up Space Age for only $3.99 [in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/space-age-a-cosmic-adventure/id922380267?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki). Pairing your iOS device with an AppleTV and putting it up on the big screen via AirPlay would be a great way to play it. They're apparently working on a Mac version of Space Age as well. [](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/space-age-a-cosmic-adventure/id922380267?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki)You can also pick up the soundtrack for the game in iTunes - [Space Age (Original Game Soundtrack) by Cabel Sasser](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/space-age-original-game-soundtrack/id937519307?uo=4&at=10l4Ki) - if you need more 8bit tunes in your life.
