Via [coudal.com](http://coudal.com/archives/2012/01/dont_be_a_dik_d.php) comes this [great game](http://blkgirlblogging.tumblr.com/post/15301683144/str8nochaser-the-terrific-kid-onehoney) for meals with your friends who can't stop checking their phone to see if a text message has come in:

### The Rules

1.  The game starts after everyone has ordered.
2.  Everybody places their phone on the table face down.
3.  The first person to flip over their phone loses the game.
4.  Loser of the game pays for the bill.
5.  If the bill comes before anyone has flipped over their phone everybody is declared a winner and pays for their own meal.

I'm thinking of certain folks who I'm going to be seeing more of just so that I can get a free meal out of them.
