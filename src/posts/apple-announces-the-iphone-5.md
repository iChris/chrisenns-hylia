[Pre-order September 14th](http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone) or pick one up in a local store September 21st. Highlights for me:

### iPhone 5

*   Larger 4" iPhone that's still thinner and lighter than the previous model. Incredible to think how much _stuff_ they're packing into a mere 7.6 millimetres thin device.
*   Support for LTE - next generation wireless data communication.
*   New A6 chip that is faster and powering a bigger display and still gives you 8 hours talk time or up to 10 hours of video playback
*   New lightning connector. Gone is the large 30 pin connector. Replaced by a smaller (and reversible) connector that will hopefully stick around for as long as the 30 point connector did.
*   Improved camera with panoramic mode and the ability to take pictures while recording video.

### iOS 6

New version of the operating system for mobile Apple devices. The first one that won't work on original iPads while still apparently working on the iPhone 3GS - though I can't imagine it'll perform all that smoothly. Still pretty incredible for a mobile device that was released in June of 2009 to run a modern operating system that's pushed as aggressively as iOS is.

*   Maps. Meh.
*   Improved Siri sounds interesting. I don't have Siri on my iPhone 4 and I've yet to see anyone really using it all that much.
*   Facebook integration. Meh.
*   Shared Photo Streams will be nice. But I assume it'll still have weird limitations or issues that crop up when trying to share things like that in Apple's narrow view of social sharing.
*   FaceTime over cellular will be good - so long as Canadian carriers don't block it somehow?
*   Remodelled aka redesigned iTunes Store, App Store and iBookstore apps. About time.

See the [bottom of the What's New page](http://www.apple.com/ca/ios/whats-new/) to figure out if your device will run iOS6. Available September 19th, 2012. [More details on iOS 6](http://www.apple.com/iphone/ios/)

### EarPods

New earphones. All the marketing speak (years of research!) won't mean anything if they don't sound good. Have to wait and see. [More details on EarPods](http://store.apple.com/ca/product/MD827/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic#overview)

### iTunes Redesign

A redesign of iTunes that is sorely needed. We'll see if user's needs are trumped by iTunes Store needs - pushing people to buy more stuff in the App Store or iTunes Store vs letting them manage their music library is proving to be a difficult line to walk for Apple. Coming in October 2012 - [details available here](http://www.apple.com/itunes/new-itunes/).
