> In his most wide-ranging interview as CEO, Cook explains how Apple works now, talks about the perception that he’s “robotic,” and announces the return of Apple manufacturing to the U.S.

I'm guessing that the anti-Apple folks will find a way to spin that last item as "Apple stealing jobs from China".
