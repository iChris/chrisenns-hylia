If you bought a Mac after June 06th, 2011 and it did't come with Lion pre-installed you can visit [www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate/](http://www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate/) to get a free upgrade to Lion via the Apple Online Store & Mac App Store. One item in the fine print is that you must submit your request within 30 days of your original purchase.
