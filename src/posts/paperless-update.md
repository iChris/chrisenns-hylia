A big update is coming to David Sparks' iBooks [Paperless](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fbook%252Fpaperless%252Fid520393162%253Fmt%253D11%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). ![Paperless](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Paperless.jpeg "Paperless")

> I'm busy preparing the next update to Paperless. It will release some time in the next month. When it comes out, you'll be able to delete the current version from iBooks and download the updated version. You won't have to buy it again. I'll post the update notes and details when it releases. There are new screencasts, new sections, the works.

It's currently $5. Next week it goes up to $10. Now's the time to [buy it if you're curious what a modern book can look like](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fbook%252Fpaperless%252Fid520393162%253Fmt%253D11%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).
