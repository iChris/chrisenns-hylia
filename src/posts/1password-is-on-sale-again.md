It's that time of the year again - 1Password, the password generating, saving and security enabling app for Mac, iOS and Windows, is on sale for 50% off. [Pick it up in the Agile Store](https://agilebits.com/store) or via the App Store links below:

*   [1Password for iPhone and iPad](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F1password-password-manager%252Fid568903335%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)

If you had to start somewhere, I'd recommend the Mac App first. It's the easiest to get going with and then eventually you'll want the iOS version so you can keep logging in to sites and services with your secure passwords. Here's a screencast on one way I use 1Password to use long, annoying passwords AND save time logging in: [Direct link to video](http://youtu.be/S3SIL3vjxeU)
