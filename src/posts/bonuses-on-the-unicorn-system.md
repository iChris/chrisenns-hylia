Shopify, an [e-commerce solution](http://www.shopify.com/), has a [unique way of awarding bonuses/extra revenue](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2378-qa-with-tobias-ltke-of-shopify):

> Every full-time employee also receives stock options and takes part in our bonus system called Unicorn. The way Unicorn works is that twice a month we deposit money into the Unicorn system as a revenue share with all employees. The system automatically splits it evenly amongst all employees. However, no one can simply take the money out. You can only “invest” it in other employees as a thank you and bonus for accomplishments. This means that bonuses are paid where the company (being the employees) thinks they are due.

Just because something has always been done one way, doesn't mean you can't be creative and think of a new way of tackling a problem like this.
