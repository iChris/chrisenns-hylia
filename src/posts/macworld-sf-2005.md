**Update:** The stream of the keynote is available now. [Click here to avoid having to read my summary.](http://stream.apple.akadns.net/) Steve Jobs is giving the big 'reality distortion field' speech right now, but Apple decided to not stream it live from the stage so you'll have to wait until tonight to get your fill. There's lots of sites doing text updates. Here's what's gone down so far:
