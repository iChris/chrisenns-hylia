My wife got the opportunity to preach a sermon a week and a bit over ago. You can go [find it on the site here](http://www.forestgrovecc.com/sermons.html). Unfortunately I can't link to her talk directly due to the site being in flash - hopefully you can find your way. It was on 08/23/2009 and she spoke about the Parable of the Rich Fool. I think she did awesome, but I may be a bit biased. Even if you're not the sermon listening to type, it's worth listening to for the random voice overs that were recorded when Sue mentioned a few local stores in her sermon.
