This is one of the reasons why I think the iPad is going to be a hit with folks once they give it a try:

> Part of it is the fact that I can go out on my terrace with a cup of coffee, a glass of lemonade, or a glass of wine and do email in a relaxed mood. If my wife or kids interrupt me, it's easy to put the thing down and engage in a conversation. **The iPad makes using a computer less of a commitment and that has important implications for the way I compute.** I like how I feel when I am using the thing.
