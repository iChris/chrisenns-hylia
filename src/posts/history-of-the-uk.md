HP has sponsored a [Nation Photo Album](http://www.nationalphotoalbum.co.uk) of the UK's history. Very cool. Some pics are copyrighted and others are public domain - a good resource if you're looking for old pictures to throw into a video or slideshow. **Also check out the [Dutch National Image archive](http://beeldbank.nationaalarchief.nl/).** _(Thanks Caroline)_
