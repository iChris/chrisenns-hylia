Sometimes things happen that makes you wonder why it took so long for it to happen. U2 has released [part of their free concert in Brooklyn](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=35792448) (near Brooklyn? What do I know, I don't live in New York) on the iTunes music store. Meanwhile, [I'm downloading a DVD of the concert from Bittorrent.](http://www.thetradersden.org/forums/showthread.php?t=1143) It'll be interesting to see how much of the music from their tour next year gets thrown online via iTunes. Hopefully other artists start getting the special treatment from Apple/iTunes. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I love hearing different versions of songs, especially live, when a band experiments a bit.
