We get it, you don't think the iPad is going to sell, it's a stupid name, it doesn't have a camera, it's dumb that Apple doesn't allow you to install your own apps on it, [it doesn't run Flash](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/28/flash-ipad) (_[See this piece by Gruber for a response to Flash and why you'll never see it on the iPhone/iPad](http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/apple_adobe_flash)_), that everything has to go through the App store, that it doesn't do X, Y or Z. [![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ipadjoketweet-300x143.png "ipadjoketweet")](http://twitter.com/reckless/statuses/8297727854) Need I remind you that the [original iPhone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iPhone_and_iPod_Touch_models) came out with only a camera on it when pretty much all the other cell phones had video recording capabilities. The original iPhone had (_and still has_) a non-removable battery. The original iPhone couldn't (_and still can't_) run Flash. etc. etc. etc. And that iPhone has [done fairly well for Apple wouldn't you say?](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/01/25results.html) So if the iPad doesn't spit out Unicorn breath in bite size tablets (_Ha! See what I did there? Tablets? Cuz everyone thinks the iPad is a new kind of tablet? Nevermind..._) like you were expecting it to and therefore you're not going to buy one, fine. I don't think Apple is marketing this to you and they weren't expecting you to buy it anyway. They aren't trying to [take away your control](http://lifehacker.com/5458690/the-problem-with-the-apple-ipad) - you have a free will to buy the iPad/iPhone or not. There are a \_ton\_ of other cell phones, tablets and computer choices out there. Apple is making a lot (as in **a lot**) of money in the mobile area but they are far from the only choice. So continue to buy your NokiaSonyMotorola mobile phone, linux powered Netbooks and cheap-like-borscht WinTel machines. They aren't going anywhere. You have that choice. **Update**: Even better response than I could write [here](http://cruftbox.com/blog/archives/001592.html#001592) via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/28/cruftbox).
