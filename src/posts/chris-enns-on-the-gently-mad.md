Hey that's me! My [Goodstuff](http://goodstuff.fm/) co-founder Adam Clark was nice enough to have me as a guest on his podcast, The Gently Mad:

> Adam is joined by fellow podcaster and Goodstuff co-founder, Chris Enns. They discuss, of course, podcasting, how Chris came to be a blogger and podcaster, and his web business, Lemon Productions.

Adam does a great job of making his interviews less interview-y and more conversational. I had lots of fun being on the other side of the mic, so to speak. [Go listen to episode 47 of The Gently Mad](http://goodstuff.fm/thegentlymad/47).
