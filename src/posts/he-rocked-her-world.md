The [Carlos Stalker Issue](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000101.html) I mentioned before has prompted 26 comments (at present). It feels a little like high school with lots of anonymous comments floating around which is to be expected on the web. I always find it interesting when people start telling you what you can and can't put up on your own website. We're not talking about porn or military secrets here, it's a friggin love letter on a piece of tie-died paper. Who buys tie-died paper anyways?
