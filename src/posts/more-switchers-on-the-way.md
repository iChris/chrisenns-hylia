Apparently the next version of Microsoft Windows, Windows 7, has a "Starter Edition" that [only allows you to run 3 applications at once](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/windows-7-starter-edition.html). I'd say they're pushing people to Mac/Linux options - [Gruber puts it a bit more bluntly](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/21/windows-7-starter).
