We haven't been updating this very much lately. But here's another picture to prove that Damien's getting cuter everyday. He's got lots of smiles for us all the time and Chris can make him squeal with laughter by rubbing his goatie on Damien's chest. Sorry the picture is so big, I'll have to figure out how to change that, but right now I don't have time. :) UPDATE: I managed to make the picture smaller.
