[Kelly](http://www.20six.co.uk/kellypeters) loaned me his copy of Season 1 of The Office a few weeks ago. I hadn't actually had a chance to sit down and watch it until this weekend. Hilarious. It's a bit crude a times, but then it's much like life... full of man-whores and drunken debauchery. Choice clips:
