I visited our local Best Buy and chatted with a helpful salesperson there who said that Telus was launching the iPhone 4 on Monday (August 23rd) in Saskatchewan. It seems like Telus could be the answer to my [iPhone 4 woes](https://chrisenns.com/2010/08/12/the-one-about-the-iphone-4-in-saskatchewan/) I've been [occupying your time with](https://chrisenns.com/2010/08/19/no-sasktel-advertising-for-iphones/).

### Benefits/Drawbacks/Neutral Thoughts

**Neutral**: Same hardware pricing as everywhere, data & voice plans are the same as far as I can tell so far, possibly better roaming agreements in the states/overseas but not really sure. **Benefits:** Shared network agreement with Sasktel, visual voicemail is apparently included in their data plan (Rogers tacks on $8/month for it), better national coverage than Rogers. **Drawbacks:** I feel like there should be more because I've just always had it in my head that it went, in Saskatchewan anyway, Sasktel, Rogers then Telus/Virgin/the rest. Now I'm not so sure - any thoughts? [Leave a comment](https://chrisenns.com/2010/08/20/iphone-4-on-telus/#comments) or [drop me an email](mailto:chris.enns+telusiphone@gmail.com).

#### Update:

[Telus to Soon Announce HSPA Coverage in Saskatchewan](http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/telus-iphone/telus-to-soon-announce-hspa-coverage-in-saskatchewan/) Besides the terrible headline writing, that seems to be confirmation.
