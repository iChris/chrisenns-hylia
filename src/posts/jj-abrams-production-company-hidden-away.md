I've been trying to come up with ideas for renovating my home office and stumbled on this portfolio piece from Howard Building Corporation for [The National Typewriter Company](http://www.howardbuilding.com/our-work/project/the-national-typewriter-company), which is a fake name for what the building actually houses: Bad Robot, JJ Abrams' production company that's helped make Lost, Star Trek, Star Wars, and many more popular TV and movie series. \[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" size="medium" ids="23255,23256,23257,23258"\] And of course, just like much of Abrams' work, there are secrets hidden in the building:

> Abrams's own bathroom requires one to pull on a book entitled Louis Tannen's Catalog of Magic to reveal the toilet behind a secret opening in the wall.

It's all just a _bit_ out of my home office budget. But I do like the look of the wood on the wall in some of the spaces - that could make for a great backdrop.
