Apple has also unified their MacBook Pro lineup with all the unibody enclosures (13", 15" and 17") being lumped together in the Pro designation. And dropped the prices. [I want to go to there.](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) Apple still sells the older white 13" MacBook so check that one out if you're looking for a good deal.
