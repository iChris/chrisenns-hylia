Since I haven't done one of these in awhile, here's some stuff I've found on the web: - Doughboy (flash req'd) - no explanation necessary - Apple plans on having real jaguar's in their stores upon the release of their new operating system, codename Jaguar. (satire warning) - Not for the easily disturbed: the BBC looks into where all the old computers go after they die - web nerds like myself should check out webmonkey for some great web design tips - These churchgoers were upset about getting a parking ticket while they were in church - giving us the quote of the week: "People shouldn't have to go to church and worry about getting a ticket" That's it for me... have a great weekend!
