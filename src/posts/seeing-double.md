Tried out [this technique](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/2005/01/very_cool_set_o.html) for pictures.  
It's easy to do an ok job of it (this took me maybe five minutes including taking the pictures and combining them in PS) but you'd have to do more planning/have a better camera/spend more time in PS to get it as good as the originals. Either way, it's still a neat idea for taking pictures.
