I received an email from most@blockauthor.com today. It reads: **Good afternoon. I don't compete with other discus throwers. I compete with my own history.** _What??? What in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks does that mean?_ **Chris, searching for a place to purchase medication?** _No, not really. We have these things called Pharmacies that sell medication to me when I give them a piece of paper called money._ **All the evolution we know of proceeds from the vague to the definite. Older people shouldn't eat health food, they need all the preservatives they can get. I know of nothing more laughable than a doctor who does not die of old age.** _Hahaha... that's hilarious Most! You tell the best jokes!_ **We are able to ship worldwide.** _Ship what? Discus throwers?_ **Old things are always in good repute, present things in disfavor.** _Very good point. I'll take that into consideration while I'm taking my crazy pills._
