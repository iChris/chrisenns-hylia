[Sue and I went for a walk down by the river on Good Friday.](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/images/goodfriday/) It was nice to get out of the house after being cooped up working on videos, web pages and BF:Vietnam all week. Well, not really "working" on BF, but that's beside the point. One more perfomance on Sunday to go, but I'm only involved with my guitar for a couple of songs. It should be interesting to see how the rockin choir is recieved. The band is having fun regardless. The Tenebrae services went well - not without their own little glitches but nothing that noticeable to the audience I think. It's always fun to play with Brent and his djembe. We talked about hooking up to try and make some tv commercials for some of his audio clients - we'll see what happens. Watch for a casting call soon! :)
