 _[Direct link to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcatQSyRK6c)_ The final season starts February 2nd. If you're one of those people who's jumped on the "Lost got crappy when...\[insert comment about writing, plot, storyline here\]" then that's fine - you can have your wrong opinion - but I for one am excited to see how they end this ride. It's easily one of the best drama/action shows on TV IMHO.
