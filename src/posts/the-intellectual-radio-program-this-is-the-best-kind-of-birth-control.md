> Justin Jackson sits in for an ill Adam Clark and we talk more GoodStuff stuff, Canadian stereotypes and other follow up. We spend the majority of the episode having a good discussion of different ways we shut off stresses of work when trying to enjoy home, friends and family. (Hint: Donâ€™t have kids!)

We took a [tweet from Jesse Atkinson](https://twitter.com/jsatk/status/428381709780791296) and used it as the basis for our discussion. Fun to have the Canadian majority on TIRP for a change. [Listen to episode 22 of The Intellectual Radio Program](http://www.ssktn.com/tirp/22/).
