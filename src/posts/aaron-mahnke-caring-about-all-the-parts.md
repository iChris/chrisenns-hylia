> Aaron’s only 6 episodes in to his new podcast Lore - a bi-weekly podcast about the history behind scary stories - but his attention to all the details of producing a story-driven podcast has resulted in unexpected but well deserved attention and popularity.

I really enjoyed this conversation with Aaron - all the more so because we set up the interview 5 minutes before it happened so I had zero prep time and we just talked. Sometimes that works out great, as with this conversation.
