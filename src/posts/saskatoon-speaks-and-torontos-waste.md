In sharp contrast to the corporate blah blah of [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qry_r4OkDrg) from the freshly launched [Saskatoon Speaks.com](http://www.saskatoonspeaks.com/) site is this video from the City of Toronto's e-waste program:  I love the idea/purpose behind [Saskatoon Speaks.com](http://www.saskatoonspeaks.com/), just not the promo video that probably cost $5-$10k to produce. Why bother producing a video that, aside from the images, could be talking about any other city in North America? Seems like a missed opportunity for an otherwise great campaign.
