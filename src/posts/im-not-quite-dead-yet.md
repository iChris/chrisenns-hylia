'm not really down for the count (yet), we were just gone on a week long missions trip with some grade 9, 10 & 11's to Pearceland, SK (four hours north of here, up past North Battleford). As I mentioned last week, I was sick going into it so that's why I didn't post anything then and we left Saturday and got back today. And now I'm starting to feel sick again! Yech! And i thought sleeping in a tent with 6 other guys would help my sickness. Doh! More details when I have pictures and more sleep.
