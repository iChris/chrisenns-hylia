Easily the best ski video I've ever seen[1](#fn-19973:1) and what I saw was only a small part of it. We saw the video below at the Banff Mountain Film Festival last night when it came through town. Incredible cinematography, music and editing. Viewing it on a computer screen doesn't really do it justice[2](#fn-19973:2) as compared to watching it on the huge screen at TCU Place. Mark it to watch later on your Apple TV. [Direct link to video](http://vimeo.com/32863936) That video is just one part of a full length movie put together by [Sherpas Cinema](http://www.sherpascinema.com/).
