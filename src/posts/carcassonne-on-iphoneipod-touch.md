The game looks and plays beautifully. Push notification and 8 CPU players to challenge along with a solitaire mode makes it [a pretty easy buy at $4.99 for now with a free upgrade to the iPad version when it comes out](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcarcassonne%252Fid375295479%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), at which point the price goes up to $9.99.

P.S. If $4.99 is too much to pay for an app like this, you and I have fundamentally different ideas of what's involved in putting something like this out. _See also: a cup of coffee at Starbucks or Tim Horton's (x3) that nets you very little long term benefits._ [![Carcassonne - TheCodingMonkeys](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-lrg.gif)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcarcassonne%252Fid375295479%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)
