If you happen to publish [podcasts on the iTunes podcast listing](http://ssktn.com) or are an app publisher on the App Store, listeners or customers can leave comments on the iTunes Store but there's no way to be notified if someone does - plus with all the international versions of the iTunes Store it would take forever to check in on all the different possible places someone could leave a comment for you[1](#fn-20470:1), never mind all the different languages possible. [CommentCast](http://marti.ca/), $5 via PayPal, does some sort of magic to aggregate all the possible comments you can receive. ![CommentCast](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MainWindow-600x389.png "CommentCast") _Via [macsparky.com](http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2012/6/3/commentcast.html)_

1.  I'm not an app developer so I don't know if there's some back end system Apple has in place for developers to be notified. I'm just a lowly podcaster. [↩](#fnref-20470:1)
