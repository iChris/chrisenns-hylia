I got in on the [MT 3.0 beta test.](http://www.movabletype.org) I also got some sort of cold. So it's a win/lose morning for me. I've been popping the high-end eichinechia pills like there's no tomorrow so hopefully it doesn't get much worse. I completed my Flash course last night. It wasn't too bad as far as courses go and I got a good start into Flash, but I probably could've figured out most of what was taught in 3.5hrs instead of 7hrs. Next time I'll just go to [Ryan](http://www.brainfuelmedia.com/postscript) and get him to teach me. I'm sure I can bribe him with a steady flow of Timmy Ho's.
