If you happened by the site on Thursday night, you may have noticed some weirdness happening. I'm playing around a bit with the theme/color as I do [every other week](http://dewade.blogspot.com/2008/01/einhundert.html). I'm curious as to what you, the reader, thinks? Hit up the poll at the bottom of this post to vote! Current site: ![Current Theme](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3525/3841063921_7278070b69_m.jpg) Black: ![Black](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2661/3841853634_3e92348a7d_m.jpg) Green: ![Green](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/3841853456_0cbb28d9ae_m.jpg) Turquoise: ![Turqouise](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3509/3841853256_bd9e424ac3_m.jpg) Brick Red: ![Brick Red](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2583/3841853088_e872b5a588_m.jpg) Gray: ![Gray](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2563/3841852920_ce3e70ef72_m.jpg) You can [go here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/tags/farawaysoclose/) to view them in a larger format if you prefer. Vote! You can choose multiple options, but you won't be able to vote more than once... unless you're a **HaX0r!@!** \[polldaddy poll=1898776\]
