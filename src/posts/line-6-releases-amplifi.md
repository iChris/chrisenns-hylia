1 part guitar amp, 1 part Bluetooth speaker. I'm intrigued. [AMPLiFi from Line 6](http://line6.com/amplifi/): http://youtu.be/zEiKGR9rGfw [Direct link to video](http://youtu.be/zEiKGR9rGfw) Jim Dalrymple has had a review model for a couple weeks and [he likes it](http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/01/23/line-6-amplifi-guitar-amp-and-ipad-app/):

> Overall, I loved AMPLIFi, both as a guitarist and from a technology standpoint. The 75 watt version costs $399 and the 150 watt model is $499. This is an amp I’ll be using a lot.

The sacrifice in tone to a cheaper DSP makes me worried about giving up my Marshall tube amp[1](#fn-21854:1) but the practical side of having a great Bluetooth speaker and amp in one package sure is tempting.
