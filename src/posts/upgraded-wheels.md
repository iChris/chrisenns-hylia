[![Damien In His New Ride](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1016/873667089_5e34b00eaa.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/873667089/) Damien got an upgraded set of wheels on the weekend. We picked up a [Chariot](http://www.chariotcarriers.com/) and had a great time trying it out around Waskesiu on the weekend. [![Taking Damien and the Chariot for a Walk](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1033/874528922_bcc222f3c4_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/874528922/) It's got decent acceleration and corners pretty good. We're going to take it out and try and do some [drifting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_%28motorsport%29) tonight.
