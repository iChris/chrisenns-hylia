A great [guest post by Nate Spears on Shawnblanc.net giving an overview of the battle for the greatest player in soccer going on right now](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/05/lionel-messi-never-dives/):

> But a lot of that would be a bit, er, inside football to the uninitiated. So I’ve decided to focus on something that’s happening on a more individual level. Right now two men playing in the Spanish League (La Liga) are playing to a sustained level of individual brilliance and one-up-manship that is unparalleled in the history of football, perhaps in the history of sport.

The drama and intensity of football [1](#fn-21419:1) is more interesting to me than what we see focused on in hockey and other sports here in Canada. It's just the time zone differences that make it difficult to keep tabs on what's happening - I need a football friend to remind me of important games coming up.

1.  It's called football everywhere else in the world so that's what I'm calling it. On the off chance I mention North American football I'll make sure to point it out so you can know what I'm talking about. [↩](#fnref-21419:1)
