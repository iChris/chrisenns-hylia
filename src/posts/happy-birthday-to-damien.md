Today's Damien's official 2nd birthday, though we're celebrating it tomorrow with his friends and cousins. Hard to believe 2 years ago: ![Damien 1 Day Old](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/628147694_d7a16006631.jpg "Damien 1 Day Old") To 1 year ago: ![Damien 1 Year Birthday](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2619304025_b2733df1e51.jpg "Damien 1 Year Birthday") To More Recent: ![Showing Off the Pine Cones](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3491296733_1d809415391.jpg "Showing Off the Pine Cones") ![Walking Up the Path](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3492110188_2fb51e0d9e1.jpg "Walking Up the Path") ![Playing in the Park](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3494376987_f6a646ba581.jpg "Playing in the Park") You can tell he's 2 by the fact that it took me over half an hour to write this post while he was getting into things, learning how to go on the potty and pulling the power cord off my laptop. Hurray for two year olds!
