[![Damien's Bucket of Cloths](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3219/2968574238_bf71b5d257.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/2968574238/ "Damien's Bucket of Cloths") Damien spent a great deal of time last weekend with this bucket filled with cloths that he took from my dishcloth/towel drawer. He would empty it out in various places, and then pick them up one at a time and put them back in. And once they were all in, he would cram them down nice & tight so he could carry them to the next location and do it all over again. It kept him entertained for several hours (or maybe just minutes) at a time!
