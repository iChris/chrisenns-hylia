Among other things, the best gift I received this father's day was this. I took Damien to the park, a 10 minute walk from where we are staying, and after playing around on the park for 10 minutes he ran up to me and said: "I forgot to say Happy Father's Day!" and gave me a hug. _Which wasn't completely true as he had said "Happy Father's Day" on more than one occasion._ He then started digging into his pocket and pulled out an individual Peanut Butter Cup mini for him and myself. Nicely squished and slightly melted. I haven't had a better tasting Peanut Butter Cup treat in my life.
