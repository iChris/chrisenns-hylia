Twitterific for iOS has been updated ([Twitterrific 5 for Twitter, $2.99 in the App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftwitterrific-5-for-twitter%252Fid580311103%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)) with a new feature they're calling "muffling" which is an alternative to what's more commonly called "muting" in apps like [Tweetbot](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-iphone%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). It's a clever way of simplifying a useful function without making it useless. The words or accounts you've muffled are then synced across iCloud to other devices you have. Watch the video to see how it's done.
