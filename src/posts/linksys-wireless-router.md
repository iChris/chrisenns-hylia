Any of you geeks out there with a Linksys WRT54G (802.11G wireless router) or thinking about getting one should take a look at this one from Linksys. [There's a whole bunch of cool, nerdy things](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040527.html) that can be done with it and Linux, which it's running on. Anyone want to buy a Hawking 802.11b wireless router so I can play with (and break) a WRT54G?
