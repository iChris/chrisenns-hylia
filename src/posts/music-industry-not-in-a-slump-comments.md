I know this is justification... BUT... Whenever I buy a spindle of CD's, I'm paying the music industry a portion of that cost. The kicker is, almost all of my CD's are used to data-backup purposes. So, I'm paying the industry for music I never acquire. I read, a while ago, that when the sales of music CD's dropped off a couple years ago, the sale of data CD's increased almost three-fold. Now, when you're charging $.25 + cents on every CD, and never having to produce a product... How much of that do you think is profit? Yeah. That's right. The whole freakin' wad. Arrrrrgh.
