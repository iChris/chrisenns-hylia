[Classy retirement letter](http://www.theplayerstribune.com/steve-nash-retirement/) from Canada's best basketball export:

> I heard someone once say there comes a day when they tell us all that we can’t play anymore. We’re not good enough. Surplus to requirements. Too slow, maybe. When you’re a teenager with outsized dreams and a growing obsession, and someone tells you this ain’t gonna last forever, it’s scary. I never forgot it.
