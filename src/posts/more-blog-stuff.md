Looks like my little update has touched off a whole slew of updates in the local blogging world as [Phil](http://duke.usask.ca/~wasylow/blog/) and [Carlos](http://bloglos.kicks-ass.net/) (go grab the new Pilate album from Carlos' site btw) have done some reinventing of their blogs as well. I found a slick little app called [Kung-Tunes](http://www.kung-foo.tv/itti.php) that pulls the latest song listing from iTunes and throws them up into a file on my web server that I can pull into this page. Whuapaa! I'm still settling into this redesign so expect some changes over the next little while but I'm digging the font size so it's staying. Get out your bi-focals or go [someone else's blog](http://www.paulmartintimes.ca/personal-paul/blogs_e.asp).
