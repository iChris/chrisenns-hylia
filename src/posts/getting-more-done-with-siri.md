I'm always surprised to hear that more people don't actually use Siri on their iPhone/iPads. I suspect it has to do with not knowing the voice commands well enough or being burned by a failed attempt to use it. To help you connect better with Siri, Lex Friedman has a couple of articles up at Macworld that will get you talking to Siri again: [Four ways to get things done with Siri](http://www.macworld.com/article/2029855/four-ways-to-get-things-done-with-siri.html) is all about setting reminders, scheduling events, texting and taking notes, and [Six tips for mastering Siri](http://www.macworld.com/article/1163896/six_tips_for_mastering_siri.html) is an older article that has a good overview of commands you can use with Siri. My wife uses Siri ever day for reminders, alarms and timers. We'd probably use it a lot more except that either our house (aka kids) are too loud or it's more of a distraction to sleeping babies to use Siri.
