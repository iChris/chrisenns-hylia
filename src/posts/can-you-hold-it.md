For example, Star Trek has 4 pee times (50 minutes, an hour, 1 hour 20, and 1 hour 40) so you've got lots of opportunities to take a quick break. They scramble the part that you'll be missing so you can come back later and find out the little bits you missed. [www.runpee.com](http://www.runpee.com)
