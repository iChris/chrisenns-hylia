I'd quote [the whole thing](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/jamie-and-jeffs-birth-plan) but I'm laughing too hard:

> While we do not have a traditional “philosophy” of “childbirth,” we have been heavily influenced by orthodox Wholefoodism and the “(d)well baby/good design” movement. We believe strongly in the power of the female body and a long-term night nurse. We are opposed to torture/gluten. In the event you are ever unsure how to proceed today, please ask yourself, “What Would Gwyneth Do?”

WWGD.

> Please don’t put the baby on a scale, as we don’t want her to have the same body image issues as her fat mom.

Anti-vaccination.

> We will not be vaccinating our baby. Please vaccinate all other babies on this floor.
