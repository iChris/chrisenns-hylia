If you're looking for a great deal on some awesome WordPress themes, hit up [WooThemes (_affiliate link_)](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l1) before Tuesday at 12am UTC. Which may happen soon. I suck at time zones. **Timezone Update:** It is, in fact, past 12am UTC in pretty much every part of the world now so the deal is over. But the theme recommendations stay the same! Use coupon code "HAPPYBIRTHDAY" to get a deal of 5 for 1 themes and 30% off in celebration of their 3rd birthday. Some of my favourite themes include:

*   [Canvas](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l64) - in use on this very blog
*   [Briefed](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l113) - designed by one of my favourite designers, [Cameron Moll](http://cameronmoll.com/)
*   [Saving Grace](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l109) - a theme built around the purpose of raising funds for a non-profit
*   [Estate](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l80) - a ready to go theme for selling real estate
*   [Postcard](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l63) - a travel blog theme that I wish I had a good excuse to use
*   [Statua](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l114) - a beautiful photo blog for photographers, amateur or pro

Whether you get their special deal or not, [WooThemes](http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l0) is one of the premiere WordPress theme developers and I always look at their themes first for any project I'm working on for myself or a [client](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/).
