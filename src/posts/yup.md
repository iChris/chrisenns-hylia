I'm still alive. Watched Supersize Me last night and am on my required 1 week avoidance of McD's. Truth be told I haven't eaten there in quite awhile, and only rarely will I hit up A&W in a moment of desperation on campus. The only fast food joint I have no will to say no to is Wendy's. I don't know if it's red haired girls or square burgers, but something about that place keeps me coming back. It's crazy nutsy busy time at the U these days. All the retarded first years running around with their gut hanging out of their two sizes too small shirt stopping at the top of the stairs to talk about how "like, I totally couldn't even understand my teacher today... and where do I, like, get my books?" Free pizza from IBM and a bunch of freebies from Sasktel have helped to nurse the rage building inside me.
