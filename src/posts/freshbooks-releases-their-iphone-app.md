Some might say _finally_ but I won't stoop to that. I'm just happy that they have the app out. I'll have to update my [FreshBooks review](https://chrisenns.com/recommends/freshbooks/) once I've had a chance to use the app, but on first glance it looks great. The ability to take a photo of a receipt for expense tracking will save me having to send those kinds of documents through [Evernote](http://evernote.com) - though having a back up there might not hurt if the tax folks came calling.
