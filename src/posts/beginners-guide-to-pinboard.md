Shawn Blanc wrote [A Beginner's Guide to Pinboard](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/09/pinboard-guide/) to explain how he uses Pinboard, a bookmarking/link saving service that I use as well - you can [view my account here](https://pinboard.in/u:iChris).

> A good filing system is one where you can find whatever you’re looking for in less than a minute. As of this sentence I have 2,334 bookmarks — I use Pinboard to collect any and every URL that is or was interesting to me — and I’ve never had trouble finding what I’m looking for when I go to search for a particular bookmark. I wanted to share a few of the tools and services I am using with Pinboard. If you are wanting to get more out of Pinboard, then hopefully this will help you out.

Pinboard isn't the same as saving bookmarks in your browser. These aren't typically sites you visit on a daily basis. These are sites, articles, tutorials, photo galleries, etc. that you come across that you want to save for later. In fact, I [saved Shawn's article to Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:iChris/b:b1aa205237a7) so that I could access it later when I have more time to dig into it. It's currently $10.21 [1](#fn-21643:1) to sign up for a [Pinboard account](http://pinboard.in/). Well worth it in my opinion.

1.  The price goes up as more people sign up. More users = more servers = higher costs to run the service. [↩](#fnref-21643:1)
