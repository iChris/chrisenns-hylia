So I did some stuff to the site that might make it a little slower in some areas, but should make for more space on the server for more important things - like my email. (doh!) I off-loaded all the pictures from our travels and music/movies to my Shaw homepage so they may take a little longer to load now, but at least I'll be able to recieve my email at work and not worry about running out of space. Other than that, I also added a 'Sign Up To Be Notified' box on the right hand side where you can pop your email address in to be notified whenever an update is done to this site. I promise to sell your email address to as many people as possible and use it to sign up for as much spam as possible. At least I'm being honest right? You appreciate honesty don't you? I thought so.
