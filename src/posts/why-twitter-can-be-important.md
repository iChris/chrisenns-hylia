Not that you have to pay attention to something like twitter, but just perhaps a bit of an understanding of why someone might want to:

> Twitter, in this sense, can be condensed to a stadium full of people. Most everyone’s yelling something, and as a whole it’s an incomprehensible wash of noise. Every once in a while, someone will start a chant…others pick it up and it grows…maybe to the point where it’s audible over the rest of the noise to a good portion of the stadium, causing other people to take notice of something they otherwise might have missed. The object is not just to amass a small army of followers, but to get them to make noise about YOU.
