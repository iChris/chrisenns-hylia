Christopher Schmitt, [fellow podcasting nerd at The Non-Breaking Space Show](http://nonbreakingspace.tv), puts on great web conferences year round. And if you want to connect with and learn from some of the top folks in web design and development, In Control 2012 looks like another ideal conference, not to mention that it's in Honolulu in December:

> A great line-up of 10 internationally recognized educators and industry leaders that includes Jessica Hische, Daniel Burka, Kristina Halvorson, and several more! Longer sessions means more time to have all of your questions answered and really grasp the topics covered.
