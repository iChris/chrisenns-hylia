Sparrow is an email client for iPhone that takes a different approach to your inbox than the default/built-in Mail.app from Apple. It's inspired more by a Twitter client and feels very similar to using a Twitter app if you've ever used one.

[It's on sale in the App Store this week - $0.99 on Tuesday and Wednesday, $1.99 on Thursday and back to its regular $2.99 on Friday.](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fsparrow%252Fid492573565%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) I picked it up and am trying it out by using all my regular email accounts on Mail.app and putting my [Lemon Productions](http://lemonproductions.ca) account in Sparrow. My thinking is that way I can check work related stuff when I want to - or ignore it when I need to. Don't be like Francis and miss your opportunity. :) https://twitter.com/churowa/status/215115964017156096
