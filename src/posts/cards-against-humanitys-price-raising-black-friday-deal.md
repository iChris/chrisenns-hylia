Rather than follow the crowd and lower prices, they raised their prices for Black Friday - by $5. Max Temkin, co-creator of Cards Against Humanity, [wrote up why and how it all went down](http://maxistentialist.tumblr.com/post/68844686496/cards-against-humanitys-5-more-black-friday):

> This is a difficult time of year for us because we spend almost no money on marketing, and it’s easy for us to get lost in the noise and money of the holiday season.

Turns out a lot of people talked about it. The press ran stories on it. And Cards Against Humanity kept their position as the best-selling toy or game on Amazon.

> The interesting thing to note is that we got a nice lift in our sales the day after Black Friday (“Regret Saturday”). That might be from people who were waiting to buy the game until it came back down in price, or, more likely, those are sales from people who heard about the game after our Black Friday press. **Not bad for an ad that paid us to run it.**

What is Cards Against Humanity?
-------------------------------

> Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Humanity is as despicable and awkward as you and your friends. The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a Black Card, and everyone else answers with their funniest White Card.

Having not played it myself, it seems like an adult version of Apples to Apples with funnier responses. Pick up your regular priced copy of Cards Against Humanity and the various expansion packs:
