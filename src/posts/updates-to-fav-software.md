A bunch of fresh versions of some of the programs I use the most on my mac:*   [NewsFan v1.3.3](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/20996): a great RSS reader to subscribe to blogs/websites
*   [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/19029): an alternative when Safari doesn't work.
*   [gCount v0.3](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/23745): A menubar icon that shows how many unread gmail messages you have.
And if you like getting pulled into the Steve Jobs reality distortion field, check out the [streaming video of Stevie](http://stream.apple.akadns.net/) announcing new displays and demoing [Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/), the next version of the Mac OS expected out sometime in 2005.
