RODE [1](#fn-21098:1) has released a new mic for iPad and iPhone users called the [iXY](http://www.ixymic.com):

> At the heart of the iXY is a matched pair of ½” cardioid condenser capsules, fixed in a perfect 90 degree ‘near-coincident’ alignment. This results in immersive and true-to-life stereo recordings, captured in incredibly high detail.

Great idea for reporters, podcasters or anyone doing any sort of audio work. I have their [VideoMic](http://www.rodemic.com/mics/videomic) that I use for recording interviews and it works great. \[gallery type="rectangular" link="file" ids="21105,21104,21103,21102,21101"\]
