We're off to Waskesiu (is that how it's spelled?) this weekend - well part of it anyways. Hopefully the storm that's brewing doesn't get too nasty and we can have a good time out there with my family. We're all packing in to one cabin so it should be fun. Saskatchewan air got sold on ebay - I think I know what business I'm starting next. Get a free game compliments of the U.S. Army. That's it for me - have a great weekend!
