Until the end of March 2013, [BusyCal 2 is on sale for 40% off at $29.99 in the Mac App Store](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fbusycal-2%252Fid567245998%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30). Many Mac nerds are disappointed with the built in Calendar (formerly iCal) app and have happily forked over the money for BusyCal 2 - which ironically enough is as much as the [OS X Mountain Lion upgrade](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fos-x-mountain-lion%252Fid537386512%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) itself.
