I really, really hope [this is a story](http://wonkette.com/415809/arizona-school-demands-black-latino-students-faces-on-mural-be-changed-to-white) that's been spun to sound worse than it is - but I really have my doubts considering the source at [this newspaper](http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/06/04/20100604arizona-mural-sparks-racial-debate.html):

> An Arizona elementary school mural featuring the faces of kids who attend the school has been the subject of constant daytime drive-by racist screaming, from adults, as well as a radio talk-show campaign (by an actual city councilman, who has an AM talk-radio show) to remove the black studentâ€™s face, and now the school principal has ordered the faces of the Latino and Black students to be changed to Caucasian skin.

Change "black" or "latino" to "First Nations" and I'm not sure Canada, particularly Saskatchewan, fares much better to be honest. _Via [@gruber](http://twitter.com/gruber/status/15445883794)_
