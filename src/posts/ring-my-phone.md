[![](http://www.flickr.com/photos/512142_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=512142 "photo sharing") I broke down and did what I said I'd never do. Buy a cell phone. And now I've become a ring-tone whore like I knew I would be. 50 Cent's 'In Da Club' makes a really good ring tone... right up there with 'Sweet Caroline' by Neil.
