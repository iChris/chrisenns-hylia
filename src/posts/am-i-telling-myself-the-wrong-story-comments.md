Thanks for sharing that. I totally agree with that statement, as it is the major reason I'm so unproductive. It's nice to hear that even successful people struggle with these things, as it gives me hope! And for the record, I think what you're doing is awesome. Keep doing what you love.

Hey thanks for the comment and kind words Crystal. I might debate what you define as a "successful person" but it's appreciated all the same. I figured that openness about my struggles would hopefully help someone else - and if nothing else it would open up the opportunity for dialogue about it.

Chris, I've shared this with a bunch of people. I've had at least 2-3 people contact me privately to say how much it meant to them. Thanks so much for sharing these thoughts (they mean a lot to me too)

Wow. Thanks a lot Justin. I didn't really want to publicize/share it myself because it felt a little weird but I'm glad it's resonated with more folks.
