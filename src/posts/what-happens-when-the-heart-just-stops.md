I can't promise this will be the last thing I post about them, but I'm such a sucker for the wailing pain of a heart broken.

> So what happens when the heart just stops Stops caring for anyone The hollow in your chest dries up And you stop believing So what happens when the heart gives up But the body goes on living The blood crawls to a slow and stops And flows away Well we got no-one to meet No love we would beseech We only have ourselves to blame for everything The was no answer in the dust And I'm missing you so much And now you're sleeping And I'm leaving Empty-handed waiting Time it will subside and we'll agree It was a given Well there was no standard we could set And the world it does regret To have to leave you in this state of bereavement You see I'm feeling everything Nothing gets by There is a hollow in my chest The time I won't forget There is no comfort in the eyes They put us always to the test I can't prepare myself for that But I work it out in time There is a love that flows between us Ever-changing everyday I worked myself up to a crawl But I'm not fearing it at all We have no reason left to stay And that's why we're leaving And there was no answer in the dust And the one I feared to trust There is a lie that drags us Beating and pulling into disappointment I'm disappointed
