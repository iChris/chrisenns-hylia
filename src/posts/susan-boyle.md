If you haven't seen this yet, you'll be seeing it all over your internets very soon: [Susan Boyle sings for Britain's Got Talent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lp0IWv8QZY) Brutally good (and appropriate) lyrics as well:

> I dreamed a dream in time gone by When hope was high And life worth living I dreamed that love would never die I dreamed that God would be forgiving. Then I was young and unafraid And dreams were made and used And wasted There was no ransom to be paid No song unsung No wine untasted. But the tigers come at night With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart As they turn your dream to shame. And still I dream he'll come to me That we will live the years together But there are dreams that cannot be And there are storms We cannot weather... I had a dream my life would be So different from this hell I'm living so different now from what it seemed Now life has killed The dream I dreamed.
