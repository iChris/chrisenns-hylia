You may (_or may not?_) have noticed a new page link up on the top navigation of this site labelled [Recommendations](https://chrisenns.com/recommendations/). I get the occasional question about what I'd recommend for doing various things on the internet, so I thought I'd put the answers into one place. [![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Faraway-So-Close1.jpg "Make Me Rich")](https://chrisenns.com/recommendations/) In the interest of full disclosure some of the links (i.e. [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?63222)) give me a kickback for recommending them, but I only recommend stuff I am either currently using or have used in the past. Have any questions about the services I'm recommending? Leave a comment here or [send me an email](mailto:chris.enns@gmail.com) and I'll do my best to answer your question.
