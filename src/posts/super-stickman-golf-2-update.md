A [big update to a great iOS game](http://www.noodlecake.com/presskits/ssg2update2/):

*   Turn based chat on each match.
*   Wagering on your match with the in-game dollars.
*   Customize your ball trails. (_It makes sense in the game. Trust me._)
*   New courses - Super Meat Boy, Gears Land, Implausible Land and Space Land: a zero gravity course.

### Trailer for Space Land Course

### Now For Free

In addition to all that, if you haven't picked it up yet - [go grab a copy right now while it's free](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/super-stickman-golf-2/id585259203?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki). I suspect that the Noodlecake crew is just suffering brain issues from the intense cold we're experiencing here in Saskatoon and will likely put the price back up to $2 when it warms up. So really, you've got some time I think.
