It's not too late to hit up the [Pilate](http://www.pilate.com/) show tonight at Louis. Doors open at 8pm, tix are $15. All the cool kids are going ([Carlos](http://bloglos.kicks-ass.net/), Trav, Teegan). [Here's a song from their show at the Ex this summer.](http://homepage.mac.com/nothedge/Movies/iMovieTheater42.html)
