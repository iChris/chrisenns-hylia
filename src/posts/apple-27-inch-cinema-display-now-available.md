Too bad it came out after my birthday: ![](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/27inchdisplay.jpg "27inchdisplay") [$1,099 gets you](http://store.apple.com/ca/product/MC007?mco=MTkwMzgyNjg) one of the nicest monitors around. What's crazy is that for [$700 more](http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_mac/family/imac?mco=MTcyMTgwNTQ) you can get a full iMac along with that display.
