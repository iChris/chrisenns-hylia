No, this is not something to do with the Cuban controversy brewing over at [Matt's place](http://www.mennoboy.com/bigboots/). I found out from [jordoncooper.com](http://www.jordoncooper.com/) that [Mark Cuban](http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/cuban_bio000329.html), owner of the [Dallas Mavericks](http://www.nba.com/mavericks/), has a [personal blog](http://www.blogmaverick.com/) that he updates fairly regularly. Apparently he also responds to most of the emails he gets from fans/customers. Amazingly enough, he uses their ideas and suggestions to better the experience customers have when they go to a Maverick's game. Imagine that? A rich, billionare CEO who listens to his customers. Do you know of any other interesting blogs like this? And don't tell me about Paul Martin's blog - it hasn't been updated in forever and was probably just some Liberal employee typing it for him anyway.
