Available only on the Mac App Store, [Final Cut Pro X is $299.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ffinal-cut-pro%252Fid424389933%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), [Motion 5 is $49.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fmotion%252Fid434290957%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and [Compressor is $49.99](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcompressor%252Fid424390742%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) as well. _(All links are Mac App Store affiliate links)_ It's pretty incredible that Apple is pushing this out through the App Store and at such a low price. For perspective, when I worked in retail we sold the Final Cut Studio at $699 for education customers - regular retail pricing was well over $1,000 - and it came with 5 or 6 DVDs that you had to install. This is a major rewrite of these applications, not just a feature release, so it's not like Apple is just pushing out a little upgrade at little to no cost to them in terms of development costs. I guess now that they've cut out all the people in the middle, Apple can sell directly to the consumer at significant savings. Now I just need a new video project to come along and justify the upgrade for me!
