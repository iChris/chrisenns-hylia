An updated version of Twitter for iOS (iPad and iPhone) is out and not a lot of favourable reviews on my Twitter feed - for whatever that's worth. Not by coincidence I'm sure, Tweetbot for iPad is on sale

*   [Tweetbot for Twitter (iPad) for $0.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-ipad%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) (normally $2.99)

Easily my favourite app. I don't even have an iPad (yet?) and I'm tempted to pick up a copy of Tweetbot for iPad just so it's on my account. For now I'll save my money until Tweetbot for Mac is finished.
