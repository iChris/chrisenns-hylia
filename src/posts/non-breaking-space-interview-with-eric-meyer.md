My [business](http://lemonproductions.ca) is in an industry that's still relatively new - it really didn't exist when I graduated from high school - there are people who were around when it started and helped set the direction and tone of how we as builders of the web would do what we're doing. ![Eric Meyer](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/300px-Eric-meyer.jpg "Eric Meyer") Eric Meyer is one of those people and we got a chance to [interview him for the latest Non-Breaking Space episode](http://nonbreakingspace.tv/eric-meyer/).

> Eric has been working with the web since late 1993 and is an internationally recognized expert on the subjects of HTML, CSS, and web standards. A widely read author, he is the founder of [Complex Spiral Consulting](http://complexspiral.com/), which counts a wide variety of corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies among its clients. Eric, along with [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/), is the co-founder of [An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/).

It was my great pleasure to be able to sit in on the interview. If you're at all interested in web design, I'd encourage you to [go listen to the show](http://nonbreakingspace.tv/eric-meyer/). You can also [listen to a bit of the after show where he teaches me about paying attention to details](http://l.ssktn.com/mJHd/play).
