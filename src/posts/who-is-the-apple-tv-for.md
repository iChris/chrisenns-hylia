Living in Canada, I didn't expect that much of the fun stuff Apple was doing on the Apple TV would be available here for awhile - if ever. And I'm hopefully not going to be buying a new TV anytime soon. But it's still disappointing to learn via [Joe Steel's recap of Apple's October event](http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html) how far behind and overpriced the Apple TV really is compared to other streaming boxes:

> There is no way to justify spending $150 to enter Appleâ€™s TV ecosystem in the fall of 2016 on hardware alone. When Google is making a streaming UHD HDR player that costs LESS than a replacement Siri Remote, there is a problem with the hardware Apple is selling.

Our current 2nd-gen Apple TV is working fine other than the Netflix app rebooting the machine randomly. So if there was a compelling reason to upgrade to a new Apple TV, I certainly would do it. But with most of the new features locked to the USA \[footnote\]Thanks Obama\[/footnote\] I think I might try out a [Chromecast](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chromecast/?utm_source=chromecast.com) the next time Netflix boots me out of a show.
