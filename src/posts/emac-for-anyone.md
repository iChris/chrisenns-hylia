I'm thinking of selling our eMac and putting the money towards an iBook for Sue - anyone interested? I haven't totally decided to sell it but there's some good prices going for them on eBay so it's got me interested. This is what you could buy right now if you were looking at a new eMac: ![New eMac](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/images/home/emac.jpg) Mine is the 1Ghz model with more RAM (640MB) but less hard drive (a 60GB). We bought it August 2003 so it still has 4 months of warranty on it. I could throw on an extra 2 years of warranty for $200. [iLife '04](http://www.apple.com/ca/ilife/) (Garageband) is on it, as is [Panther](http://www.apple.com/ca/macosx/overview/). I think we may even still have the original box. Even if you're not interested in buying it, if I listed it on ebay is $1000 a fair price?
