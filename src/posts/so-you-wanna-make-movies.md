o as I'm doing a bunch of Apple training here at work, I'm realizing once again how much I'd really like a Mac - if we could afford one. Powermac G4 933 - $3,169 17" Apple Studio Display - $1,199 Sony DCRTRV740 Video Camera - $1,099 Final Cut Pro - $449 DVD Studio Pro - $819 Firewire Cable - $12 All for only $6,747 ($7,624 w/taxes) You can even throw in an extra $1500 for a DigiDesign Digi001 and be setup for video and audio production. Well, all I can really do is put it on my Christmas list I guess. :) (note: all prices are education pricing only and are available at The Campus Computer Store. :) )
