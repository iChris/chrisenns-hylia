I had a Zeldaman retweet yesterday that didn't seem to stick. It got we worked up enough to write about it on my site. Twitter is a funny thing. [http://wesleyeterry.com/2012/05/zeldman-retweet/](http://wesleyeterry.com/2012/05/zeldman-retweet/)

Did your comments area change in the last minute? Anyway, I had a Zeldaman retweet yesterday that was exciting enough for me to write about. Twitter is awesome. [http://wesleyeterry.com/2012/05/zeldman-retweet/](http://wesleyeterry.com/2012/05/zeldman-retweet/)

Nope - just has to be approved before it'll appear.

And that it is odd that you'd get notification of a fav/RT but then not have them actually appear. But it does appear in his list of favourites on Twitter.com [https://twitter.com/#!/zeldman/favorites](https://twitter.com/#!/zeldman/favorites) - screenshot: [http://l.ssktn.com/wuJV](http://l.ssktn.com/wuJV)

Yeah. I actually think it is kind of cool that it worked out that way. It made it more exciting for me. Just like in your post above, investigating what happens with something like that is the fun part. Yay Internet!
