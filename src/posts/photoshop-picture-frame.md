![Photoshop Frame](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Picture-31.png "Photoshop Frame") I forget where I found this (I came back to my computer with the browser window open) but it looks really sweet - a [Photoshop window inspired photo frame](http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/photoshop-photo-frame). As in analog (real) photo.

> The Photoshop Photo Frame is designed with all the familiar features of a standard Mac OS X Photoshop window -- scroll bars, gray and white checkered pattern and all. Every detail pixelated and screen-printed to perfection.

Nerd gift if there ever was one.
