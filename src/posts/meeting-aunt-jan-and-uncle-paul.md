[![Auntie Jan and Damien](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1146/748712265_39ca609345_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/748712265/) Damien got to meet one of his Aunt and Uncles this weekend. Jan and Paul decided to make a quick trip out to see their new nephew. And in about a month he'll get to meet his other Aunt/Uncle and cousin when Chris and Lorinda and Samuel make the trek out from Australia.
