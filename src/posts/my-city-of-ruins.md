Senseless violence like [this](http://www.thestarphoenix.com/sports/StarPhoenix+journalist+hospital+after+assault/2630627/story.html) is hard for me to understand. I cannot fathom how one person can leave another human being to die in the streets:

> Police arrived on scene, just blocks from Florence's Mayfair-area home. They found him conscious but unable to communicate and with a severe head injury, Voisard said. None of his belongings appear to have been stolen.

I would guess it was either a gang initiation (i.e. go beat up some random person and you're in our club) or just a purely random stoned/drunk/whatever assault. Whatever the reason, it isn't right.

> There's a blood red circle on the cold dark ground and the rain is falling down The church doors blown open I can hear the organ's song But the congregation's gone My city of ruins My city of ruins Now the sweet veils of mercy drift through the evening trees Young men on the corner like scattered leaves The boarded up windows The hustlers and thieves While my brother's down on his knees My city of ruins My city of ruins Come on rise up! Come on rise up! Now there's tears on the pillow darling where we slept and you took my heart when you left without your sweet kiss my soul is lost, my friend Now tell me how do I begin again? My city's in ruins My city's in ruins Now with these hands I pray Lord with these hands for the strength Lord with these hands for the faith Lord with these hands I pray Lord with these hands for the strength Lord with these hands for the faith Lord with these hands Come on rise up! Come on rise up! Rise up
