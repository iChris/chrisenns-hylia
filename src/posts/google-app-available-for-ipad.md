The iOS Google+ app has been [updated with a iPad option](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2012/07/google-app-for-ipad-available-now-in.html), as well as being updated with these features:

*   We recently launched Events on Google+, and now you can create and manage them right from your iPhone. Post a comment, upload a photo or check out whoâ€™s going. Your past event invitations are saved with all the photos and posts shared by your friends, so you can relive the party anytime you want.
*   Start a Hangout from anywhere
*   Start a Hangout from your iPad and stream it to your TV using AirPlay

I really love the tech and design of Google+ - but I'm not willing to try and convert anyone to use it just yet. And that's perhaps the biggest problem facing Google. People will try and convince friends/family to join Twitter or Facebook. Google+ is still a 'meh' for most folks. You can [circle me on Google+ if you like](https://plus.google.com/118123290386382463789/) - but for right now it's mostly links to blog posts here and the occasional attempt at Hangouts.
