Jason Kottke has a [round up of all the links you'll need](http://kottke.org/12/03/mad-men-coming) to get caught up on Mad Men before Sunday's season 5 premiere.

> With such a long break, there's been quite a bit of Mad Men news floating around. In order to cut it down a little, most of this stuff is from the last week or so. Don't try to eat it all in one sitting you'll get a stomach ache and have to sleep off your hangover on your office couch.
