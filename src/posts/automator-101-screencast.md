Here's a quick screencast I did of how Automator works at a basic level. Nothing too fancy in this video, just renaming 7 files that could probably have been done manually but I thought I'd use the opportunity to show how Automator works and help you see how you might be able to use this app that's built-in to OS X to save some time. I was writing a [blog post on Lemon Productions](http://www.lemonproductions.ca/2012/01/got-a-band-need-a-website-for-your-band/) and wanted to include some screenshots of the WordPress theme I was talking about and... well, I don't want to spoil the ending. Just watch the video. It's pretty intense.[1](#fn-20013:1) [Direct link to video on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/35699433) / [Direct link to video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4tkR5T9rsY)
