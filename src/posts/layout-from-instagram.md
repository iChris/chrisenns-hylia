From [the Instagram blog](http://blog.instagram.com/post/114416360957/layout-from-instagram):

> Today weâ€™re announcing Layout from Instagram, a new app that lets you easily combine multiple photos into a single image.

The app I was occasionally using for this purpose was last updated for iOS 6 so it's good timing for me. It makes sense to not put this inside the existing Instagram app - people are searching for a layout/photo arranging app anyway. Might as try and keep them inside the Instagram ecosystem rather than using a 3rd party app and hope they remember to post back to Instagram. As with [Hyperlapse](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki), Layout by Instagram is [available for iOS first in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/layout-from-instagram/id967351793), apparently available on Android in the coming months.
