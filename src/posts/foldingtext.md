Yet another text editor. Billed as "Plain text productivity for geeks", [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com) is in beta but it brings some neat tricks to the relatively simple text editor genre of apps. Click on the 'Watch Movie' link at the bottom of [the FoldingText site](http://www.foldingtext.com) - I'm unable to directly link to it - to see how it works as well as features that are coming. The to do list and timer functionality that are coming soon look particularly neat. My mistake - these are in there I just didn't [read the instructions properly](http://support.foldingtext.com/kb/frequently-asked-questions/how-to-create-pomodoro-worksheet-in-foldingtext). It won't be for everyone but for the right type of Mac user, FoldingText could be a great simple, powerful tool.
