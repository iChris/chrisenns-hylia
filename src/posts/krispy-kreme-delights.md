![Jamie is home!](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/images/family/jamiehome.jpg) My sister Jamie came home from Mazatlan yesterday after being gone since January. We only got to spend a bit of time with her over supper but it was good to have our fam all together again. In a couple of weeks her Mexican b/f comes and we get to run him through the gauntlet to see if he checks out okay. ![The new pudgy faces of Krispy Kreme](http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/images/family/krispycouple.jpg) Since my mum and sister picked Jamie up in Calgary, they decided to bring along a little extra suprise for supper in the form of 2 dozen Krispy Kreme donuts. There wasn't exactly 2 dozen by the time they got home, but it was close enough that Sue and I got to experience the phenomenom that is Krispy Kreme. My verdict: very low-fat and very Atkins friendly.
