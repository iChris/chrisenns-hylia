If you're looking for a way to remotely control a Mac (i.e. in an office with a bunch of Macs you administer or from your couch because you want to turn on iTunes) you need to use a VNC[1](#fn-21401:1) program. I use Apple's own [Remote Desktop](http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/), $79.99 [](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fapple-remote-desktop%252Fid409907375%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), which works great but doesn't have an iPhone/iPad client.

### Enter Screens

Screens VNC is what I'd buy if I had it to do all over again. And both their Mac and iOS apps are 50% off right now. [Screens VNC for Mac is $14.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fscreens-vnc-control-your-computer%252Fid446107677%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and [Screens VNC for iPhone and iPad is $9.99](http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fscreens-vnc-control-your-computer%252Fid400012962%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) right now during their sale. With iCloud syncing of all your bookmarked computers it would make it simple to log in and update, fix or check on any of your Macs, Windows or Linux PCs.
