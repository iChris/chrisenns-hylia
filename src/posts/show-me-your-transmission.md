Kyle and Kenny Roderick were nice enough to invite me on their show [Transmission](http://goodstuff.fm/transmission) for episode #127:

> Today on Transmission: Come here Max - we're answering your questions today, I want my lightbulbs to act as one, Someone spent Dr-Evil-level money in NY, Nerf guns are cool again, The plumber who became self-aware, GARCO is becoming more like us, We play some sort of song challenge, and more.

It took all my effort to not just sit and giggle the whole time. I think I did ok. [Listen here on Goodstuff.fm](http://goodstuff.fm/transmission/127) or [check it out in iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/transmission/id843374491?mt=2).
