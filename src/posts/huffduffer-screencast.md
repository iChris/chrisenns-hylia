I really love websites that fix a niche problem - how to listen to random audio podcasts that you find around the internet when you don't want to subscribe to a whole podcast. Enter [HuffDuffer](http://huffduffer.com/). Alternatively watch it on:

*   [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWYYbOg75hA)
*   [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/39378849)

Feel free to [add me to your Huffduffer collective](http://huffduffer.com/iChris).
