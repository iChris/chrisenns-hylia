I can't stop watching this intro video to [Square](https://squareup.com/), a credit card reader and payment system for iPhones, by [Adam Lisagor](http://lonelysandwich.com/) - the bearded dude in plaid explaining it all to you (_who's promised me [via Twitter](http://drp.ly/oscfA) to reveal all his secrets if I can just get down to San Francisco or whatever town he lives in and buy him a beer_):  Or [just the muzak](http://lonelysandwich.com/post/385875379/square-up-sucker) which is delightful in it's own right. _[Direct link to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSzsFAJAKHI&feature=player_embedded)_
