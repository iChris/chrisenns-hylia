I decided to update my [old iOS upgrade guide](https://chrisenns.com/2011/11/how-to-upgrade-your-iphone-over-the-air-ota/) with new iOS 7 based screenshots and with iOS 7.1 out (full details [on Macrumors.com](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/03/10/apple-releases-ios-7-1/), [Macworld.com](http://www.macworld.com/article/2105988/ios-7-1-adds-carplay-interface-tweaks-accessibility-enhancements.html) or [Apple.com](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7-update/)), now's as good a chance as any.

### Minimum Requirements

First make sure your device meets the compatibility requirements Apple has specified for iOS 7. You can check [Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/features/) or view the screenshot I've embedded below: \[gallery type="rectangular" link="none" ids="21912"\] Unlike your computer where you might be able to run a new game or app on an older computer that doesn't meet the minimum system requirements and just deal with slower performance or graphics, Apple's iOS updates simply won't install on a device Apple hasn't approved.

### Find Settings.app

It's the gear looking icon. If you can't remember where you put it, try swiping down to use Spotlight and start typing "settings": ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-00](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-00-400x600.png)

### General

Scroll down until you see **General** ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-01](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-01-400x600.png)

### Software Update

Tap Software Update - which might have a 1 beside it indicating there's an update waiting. Otherwise tap through and it will check for an update. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-02](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-02-400x600.png)

### Checking for Update

Your iOS device will ping Apple's software update servers to see if there's a new version. ![Checking for Updates](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-03-400x600.png)

### iOS 7.1 Download and Install

Tap the **Download and Install** option to get this party started. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-01](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-01-400x600.jpg)

### Terms & Conditions

Lawyer speak for "We're not responsible if this breaks your phone because, like, yo." ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-02](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-02-400x600.jpg)

### Downloads Ahoy

It'll now begin downloading. Your download size will vary depending on what version of iOS you're upgrading from. In my case I had iOS 7.0? installed so it was a 152MB update. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-03](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-03-400x600.jpg) At this point you can switch away and use your iOS device for other stuff while it's updating. (I got a phone call during my update. Thanks Mastercard!) From my roots in the Microsoft Windows world I'm always sketchy about doing anything else while a software update is happening so your mileage may vary.

### Preparing Update

After downloading it will prepare the update. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-04](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-04-400x600.jpg) ...and then it will continue to prepare... ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-05](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-05-400x600.jpg)

### Install iOS 7.1 Update

Confirm that what you've started you'd like to finish. **Note**: Depending on your device and version of iOS that you're upgrading from, it can take a half hour to update. So if you have a meeting in 5 minutes, you may want to do it later. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-04](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-04-400x600.png)

### Verifying the Update

Wait! We need to verify that what we just downloaded is what we want to install. So wait! ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-05](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-05-400x600.png)

### Long White Bar of Upgrade Process

Now you wait while your iOS device gets updated. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-06](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-06-600x400.jpg)

### Boom, You're Done

It took about 30 minutes for me start to finish. Your mileage may vary. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-07](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-07-400x600.png) If you navigate back to **Settings.app**, **General** and **Software Update** you should see that you're good to go with iOS 7.1. ![tutorial-upgrade-ios-08](https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-08-400x600.png) How does iOS 7.1 feel on your device? My initial impressions on my iPhone 4 is that it's snappier. We'll see after more extended use.
