Coming home and seeing all the work related emails really has me questioning working at a computer store again. Spending my day finding a really good deal on a computer for someone just doesn't hold the same appeal for some reason. It's part of coming down from a trip like that, I know, so I'll hold off writing a letter of resignation right now :). It's good to have reminders like this past week has been that there's a whole lot more to life though.
