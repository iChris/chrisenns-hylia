If you're like me, you probably think that with all that you hear and see about the iPhone it gives you the impression that it's **everywhere**. But according to an [analyst report out today](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/08/18/analyst-apple-to-sell-80-million-iphones-in-2012-snag-5-7-of-total-mobile-phone-market/), Apple is expected to have just under 6% (82 million units) of the overall mobile market share in 2012. They had 1.1% (13.7 million units) of the overall market in 2008. Huge growth, to be sure, but 6% of the market is still a fairly small number. There's still a metric ton of other phones out there and lots of room for competition and growth. That being said, for a smartphone to have come out and capture that much market share so quickly is incredible.
