Electric guitar on a Mumford & Sons track? Will the hipsters be able to even stand it? Apparently not, based on "Roadhouse2"'s review:

> No banjo. That is all I hear about the new album. I fear it is more then the banjo that is lost here. Now, I can appreciate Mumford wanting to expand and grow, but they may have strayed too far away from what made them stand out of crowd and have entered the tired, boring recycled sound that permeates the airwaves these days.

That's after hearing 1 song. Out of 16 on the album. Tread carefully ye banjo lovers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW6SkvErFEE [Direct link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW6SkvErFEE) Pre-order Wilder Mind on iTunes:
