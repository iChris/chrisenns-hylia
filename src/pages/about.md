This website is written by Chris Enns (surprise!), a podcast editor and producer living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

I own <a href="http://lemonproductions.ca">Lemon Productions</a>, where I help people produce fun, creative, and interesting podcasts each week.

I'm also passionate about helping others podcast and am working on that over at <a href="http://goodstuff.fm">goodstuff.fm</a>.

This website is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I publish the content through a CMS called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). I often write in the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but I will also make use of [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) if I need more time to think.
